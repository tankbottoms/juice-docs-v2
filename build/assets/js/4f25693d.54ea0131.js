Are they holding back token narration for all projects right now?"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"jango: We\u2019re gonna run a script to help go through play by play of what we\u2019re doing. We re-deployed basically all the contracts except for Juicebox projects(so they can keep their NFT i.e. the ownership to the projects) and a few auxiliary contracts that don\u2019t have dependency. We re-deployed the token contract, funding cycle store, the terminals, etc. Once projects re-launch their funding cycles, everyone starts from Funding cycle #1 again. The front end made it very easy to use the same configurations as their previous funding cycle in the old contract had. Once they make that, they also have 0 token supply in the new token contract. But several projects have already received funds and started distributing tokens."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"The original plan was to have project owners initiate a few transactions to airdrop tokens to their token holders, which is super doable but requires 3-4 transactions and it\u2019s a bit complicated. In general, the scope of the problem is very small, given where we are in the protocol deployed a few weeks ago. So instead, I\u2019m gonna send a few transactions that we scripted after this Town Hall that\u2019s gonna deposit and basically re-created the activities for each project. Let\u2019s say moonmars have received 10 payments each with its memo and it beneficiary of token. We\u2019ll just send those out again. And from the deployer wallet as we run the script, we will pay in some ETH and set the original beneficiary of tokens as a beneficiary. So once all the activities are up again, then the token balance of each project should reflect their old token balance.

I think it\u2019s better to solve this problem with money, than to cause poor UX, and I think it\u2019s worthy given its scale. But this also taught us a lot about how to solve this problem given a larger scope. That loss is in lieu of communication headaches that cause us to make sure that the projects are clicking the right button and not getting themselves into other nuts.

The big one is projects that have deployed ERC-20, which is the most expensive transaction.

I went through to empty those out as the UI no longer interacts with them. You can always go to etherscan.io to pull them out. I think litDAO has a 100% overflow, so any funds in there can be redeemed by token holders. So if you did contribute to the DAO before, it\u2019s now a fine time to go and redeem, or they can submit a reconfiguration on the old funding cycle to raise and pull funds out.
