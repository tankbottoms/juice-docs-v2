Around 2014/2015ish, I was building this app in iOS dev world. That was back in my younger days when I loved building shit, working with friends, piecing together who\u2019s good at what, etc. We didn\u2019t have a tonne of users on the app, but we had an open slack server where several users would come hang out with the builders"),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"We didn\u2019t want to think about price, business models, advertising etc. We just wanted to build, and we didn\u2019t like thinking of this structure with users on one side to pay fees, and builders on the other to create and get paid, since we felt like the folks using the app were a part of the building process as well."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"One day I was sitting with my notebook, trying to figure out how this whole thing was going to play out, and I captured an idea floating by. If we figured out exactly how much it would cost to run this thing, including server hosting, salaries, and so on, we could come up with one number we needed to get to by the end of the month. When we realized we could enumerate exactly what those expenses were to the users, fully transparently, and tell them listen, this is what we need to get to each month for the service to run, and if we exceed this number, we\u2019re going to use that overflow to push down the price of the product\u2013 once we realized that, we just ran with the idea and that became the product. It seems like a win-win\u2013 the team gets paid, the users get a service, and if it becomes more successful, the service becomes more and more affordable, or even free."),(0,n.kt)("h3",{id:"that-sounds-like-a-light-bulb-moment-how-did-it-translate-into-your-project-at-that-time"},"That sounds like a light-bulb moment.

Around that same time I was delving into crypto, learning about the blockchain, smart contracts, and then in hit me: this idea was executable, but we were totally swimming against the current trying to do it in the Web 2 space. So I hunkered down and jumped into learning everything I could about smart contracts, did some prototypes, and by that time a lot of the team was like man, I can\u2019t get dragged on another project, so I decided to kind of jump in head-first and take the lead on seeing how this would play out. I figured the moment we had something tangible, all these brilliant people who I\u2019d met and who I had the luxury to spend time with would just hop on and help give it life."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"At this point I was working hard along with peri to get this concept built out, and we actually went a few different iterations of the name. There was \u201cthe sustainers market\u201d, back in the Web 2 world, and then eventually we called it \u201cfountain\u201d, because of how overflow from payments kind of would trickle down, and then at a certain point, I think it was peri who said, let\u2019s just call it \u201cmilk\u201d, and we got real funky with it and said fine, and so it was \u201cmilk\u201d for about five minutes, and then we decided on \u201cjuice,\u201d and that actually stuck for a while. It wasn\u2019t until like a week before launch that we felt like man, something\u2019s missing, and then somehow we came up with \u201cJuicebox,\u201d and we all felt immediately like yes, that\u2019s the one, and so we launched with that."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"In terms of where JB is today: everyday it changes a little bit, and early on we had no idea how it would be used.

I don\u2019t think people are bad for DAOs, but ideas can certainly take root and harm the operation of a DAO. The interesting thing is early on in a DAO, ideas that come up for vote are not only important short-term, but also precedent-setting. This is a double-edged sword though, because while setting precedent can kind of immunize a DAO against future bad ideas, it can also lead a DAO to try to solve new problems with old methods. All of this is still in a nascent stage, and very fragile, so it\u2019s interesting to see how it plays out, but I do think a DAO has some built-in mechanisms, certainly JB does, that kind of helps it move in positive, productive directions."),(0,n.kt)("h3",{id:"speaking-of-how-fragile-all-this-is-how-do-you-approach-managing-risk"},"Speaking of how fragile all this is, how do you approach managing risk?"),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"A lot of the things I learned come from taking risk, and I\u2019m not a risk averse person. In this context specifically, maybe as a programmer of the contracts you tend to feel a bit more of that weight, and you can sense a community in anticipation, and a zealousness, and so just peeling toward balance in general I think is healthy. More generally, and this is something I constantly point out, is that we need to keep the focus\u2013 it\u2019s tempting to go to the next thing prematurely\u2013 but we need to keep the focus and stay the course on the tasks in the here and now."),(0,n.kt)("h3",{id:"jb-seems-so-inclusive-and-friendly-so-im-wondering-where-are-all-the-assholes"},"JB seems so inclusive and friendly, so I\u2019m wondering: where are all the assholes?"),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"I\u2019m kind of a proponent of assholery, if it\u2019s needed.

I don\u2019t think being an asshole is good, obviously, but sometimes you do need to focus in the conversation, and there will always be some people who don\u2019t want to do that, but I think that\u2019s where the limit is to the inclusivity.
