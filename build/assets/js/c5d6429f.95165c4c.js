So I tried to create the situation exactly and was still struggling to do so. What ended up being the exact step to follow to recreate the bug which I eventually found was: if you create a funding cycle or configure a funding cycle with a duration and then let it roll over to the next funding cycle without reconfiguring, now you\u2019re in the 2nd funding cycle, now you\u2019re in the 2nd funding cycle of the 1st configuration. Then you configure the subsequent one, and before the current cycle is over, you reconfigure the subsequent one again to override the previous configuration.

So someone can come in right now and put in like 6m dollars worth of ETH and they basically get 50% of the JBX supply or whatever. If they weren\u2019t trying to coordinate with the rest of us, they could take everyone\u2019s assets then basically use that big pool of JBX to control whatever was there before. The point of redeeming is that if somebody does that in a way that\u2019s not trying to integrate with the current system, then anyone who currently has JBX is basically getting a shit ton of money from this person who comes in, so anyone who doesn\u2019t want to be a part of that ecosystem can redeem basically and leave with a big chunk of what was just poured in. So this is in a way to disincentivize this takeover thing.

So it\u2019s absolutely a luxury to have 4 or 5 really delicious projects on the finish line right now. But figuring out a way to actually take them through the finish line in a way that makes cohesive sense is gonna be a lot of fun and can take a lot of patience from a lot of folks who have been working on each of these projects. But I think many of them don\u2019t really have and might find themselve wanting something if we don\u2019t do another piece beforehand. If we try to do them all at the same time, it\u2019s probably gonna be like everything somewhat half baked. We\u2019ll revisit this discussion probably for 15-20mins in every Town Hall to give updates on where we are at."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"I think this line of thinking at least makes cohesive sense from our current standpoint, but can always change over time."),(0,a.kt)("h2",{id:"5-nft-framework-by-tankbottomseth"},"5.

But in the recent discussions, originally any NFT that came out of this system is tied to a project, but there\u2019s a bunch of feedback with a basic point that lets people do just whatever they want to do. I\u2019m really looking forward to Aeolian's splits. The idea is making an NFT as a project owner or as a project contributor for a project to sell on the market place of Juicebox. There are everyone\u2019s ideas to roll into advanced mode or simple mode. There can be instructions on image NFT, music/video NFT, and p5.js.

How would that look?"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"@tankbottoms: For things that need to be minted, this area where you can contribute could be a tab where you can mint an NFT. There\u2019s also the idea that makes a kind of landing page for a mint, then there\u2019s also the idea to have a Juicebox marketplace like Jango did. There\u2019s definitely more experimentation where it\u2019s gonna leave. The core ideas are making this tool pretty fancy and giving projects the continuous reasons to get ETH going into the treasury. They don\u2019t have to worry about the whole split thing at some point after they do their NFT thing, like how much you want to go to the treasury or go to your wallet. I think that would be super useful."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"@mieos: I think the NFT capacity inside juicebox is gonna add a lot of functionalities for projects and sort of just simplify this heady shit for staking projects.

But it\u2019s kind of a self-contained project for the time being, for sure it will make its way to product, once a lot of these granular things get knocked out in the next several months. I think this project could certainly have life on its own, maybe on its own site for experimentation to start. I feel very confident about the product per se and it\u2019ll be unfolded in due time. "),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"@nicholas: That was really what I wanted to say. It\u2019s so powerful and has so many tools in what you build. You\u2019ve created all-in-the-best class creation tools in one tool. I know you\u2019ve got ideas about on chain also, so it\u2019s even like tools that barely exist and are separated from multiple products. If you are a generative artist, there\u2019s a couple of things out there that you can use. There\u2019s a few artblock clones, then there\u2019s a manifold that has something, there are private companies that can work with you, is it good enough to be in direct competition with those things like a choice on people\u2019s mind? Or is it like I want to do a Juicebox project and I want to fund it with NFT? I think the truth is probably it can do all of those things. I think probably just have it on its own site, as it\u2019s going to be difficult to integrate elegantly.
