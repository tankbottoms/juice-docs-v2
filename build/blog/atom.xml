Nouns are 32x32 pixel characters with heads that represent a noun like “igloo,” “skateboard,” or “peanut.” One Noun is auctioned every twenty-four hours, forever, with all proceeds going to the Nouns treasury. When one auction is settled, the next Noun is generated and a new auction begins. Each Noun is entitled to one vote in Nouns DAO governance which decides how the treasury should be used.  </p><p>Auction bids for Nouns can easily reach over 100 ETH. As a result, owning a Noun is often limited to those that can afford to win these competitive auctions… unless you’re a member of SharkDAO ⌐◨-◨  </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sharkdao-a-shiver-of-nouns-enthusiasts-">SharkDAO, a shiver of Nouns enthusiasts 🦈<a class="hash-link" href="#sharkdao-a-shiver-of-nouns-enthusiasts-" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Did you know that a group of sharks is called a shiver? SharkDAO brings together Nouns enthusiasts with the shared goal of acquiring Nouns and contributing to the Nouns ecosystem.

Since Nouns has no roadmap from the Nounders (founders), Nouns is community-owned which gives power to holders to propose initiatives and decide how to use treasury funds. In other words, the task of building community and shaping the future of Nouns belongs to community members who hold Nouns, rather than the founders. SharkDAO, as one of only a handful of sub-DAOs within Nouns DAO, is one of the groups building this roadmap on-the-fly.</p><blockquote><p>“In short, sub-DAOs participation in a DAO is shaping and contributing a voice to that community so that the best ideas get surfaced, voted on, and make an impact in the world.”</p></blockquote><p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/dropnerdETH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropnerd</a></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="SharkDAO and NounsDAO infographic from sharsk.wtf" src="/assets/images/sharkdao-infographic-fab5b06c2afd5139de3246d234491e69.png" width="2003" height="1052" class="img_ev3q">  </p><p class="subtitle">SharkDAO and NounsDAO visualization from <a href="https://sharks.wtf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sharks.wtf</a></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sharkdao-the-meme-that-jumped-from-rinkeby-to-mainnet">SharkDAO, the meme that jumped from Rinkeby to mainnet<a class="hash-link" href="#sharkdao-the-meme-that-jumped-from-rinkeby-to-mainnet" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>It all started with a small group of frens helping Nouns DAO test out their auction mechanism before it went live. <a href="https://twitter.com/Goldypix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goldy</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/punk4156" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4156</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dropnerdETH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropnerd</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/LithiumXBT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lithium</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kenbot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenbot</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/iamDelPiero" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Del Piero</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/eldefijesus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Defi Jesus</a> were a few of these early swimmers.

Dropnerd was doing the testing and was still new to signing transactions. “I was very excited to see everything come together so easily without needing to interact with a bunch of smart contracts directly,” he explained. “The UI showed me exactly what was going on which made it a lot easier for the DAO. Looking back I can’t think of another platform where we could have raised 200+ ETH in the first few days without the help of Juicebox.  </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7"

Over the next 24 hours the bidding quickly went past Ξ100 and then Ξ200 soon after. It became clear that the price of Noun 47 was going to swim past most Nouns auctions, apart from the very first Noun that sold for Ξ600. After their penultimate bid of Ξ244.82, SharkDAO was getting pretty close to exhausting the amount that they set aside for the auction.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>How Lexicon Devils is building the metaverse, getting paid to do it, and managing their treasury on Juicebox.</em></strong>  </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="metaverse-architecture-and-video-games">Metaverse architecture and video games<a class="hash-link" href="#metaverse-architecture-and-video-games" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I spent the majority of my childhood exploring the internet and playing classic computer games like <em>Age of the Empires</em>, <em>The Secret of Monkey Island</em>, and especially <em>The Sims</em>. For hours and hours I would build, design, and arrange anything I could think up. Unbound by the limits of gravity, money, or even common sense, <em>The Sims</em> was an excuse to imagine what was possible rather than what was realistic. At the time this maybe seemed like a silly diversion, but like many of our early internet activities this turned out to be great practice for the future that was hurdling towards us. Spending hours customizing a Myspace page was, in retrospect, a great introduction to frontend development. And perhaps The Sims was the perfect introduction to metaverse architecture.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Old Town, The Sims" src="/assets/images/old-town-ea86a9134cb5edd263f914e755c8597f.png" width="800" height="600" class="img_ev3q"></p><p class="subtitle">Old Town in The Sims (2000)</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lexicon-devils-origin-story">Lexicon Devils origin story<a class="hash-link" href="#lexicon-devils-origin-story" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://juicebox.money/#/p/lexicondevils" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lexicon Devils</a>, named after an EP by LA punk rock band Germs, is a guild of metaverse builders architecting virtual experiences in Voxels, Substrata, and beyond. They acquire parcels, design and execute complex builds, and organize interactive events including DJ sets, treasure hunts, parades, art exhibitions, and performances.</p><p>Around the time that Shark DAO was making waves, <a href="https://twitter.com/peace_node" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peacenode</a> got a call from <a href="https://twitter.com/I_AM_STAV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stav</a> and started chatting with <a href="https://twitter.com/nnnnicholas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicholas</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dropnerdETH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropnerd</a> about this “beautiful infrastructure layer of the internet that we’re all building on Ethereum.” One thing led to another and <a href="https://twitter.com/peace_node" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peacenode</a> was soon talking with <a href="https://twitter.com/Mieos_ETH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mieos</a> from <a href="https://juicebox.money/#/p/wagmistudios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WAGMI Studios</a> about a cross-DAO collaboration to create a Juicebox metaverse experience and the rest is history.</p><blockquote><p>I’ll never forget meeting Wacko, he was rocking the most insane wearables every 30 seconds. We just had to ask if he could join us and put him on the payroll.</p><p>— Peacenode</p></blockquote><p>Rather than sending funds p2p, Peacenode explained that the <a href="https://juicebox.money/#/p/lexicondevils" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lexicon Devils project on Juicebox</a> would issue payouts to a team of contributors on a set schedule. In other words: “I know you don’t know us, but let’s hang out.” Building in the open with a trustless, transparent treasury means easily building friendships and communities regardless of identity or credentials. Find your community, bring the good vibes.</p><p>And who knows, you might even end up making an ultra tropical banana-themed learning center complete with an animated gondolier.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The first iteration of the Juicebar and Juicebox Learning Center" src="/assets/images/juicebox-v1-79e1ef4f8b0c977a672a77ec2de20e84.jpg" width="5212" height="1558" class="img_ev3q"></p><p class="subtitle">The first iteration of the Juicebar and Juicebox Learning Center</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-home-for-banny-iterations-of-the-juicebox-parcel-in-voxels">A home for Banny: iterations of the Juicebox parcel in Voxels<a class="hash-link" href="#a-home-for-banny-iterations-of-the-juicebox-parcel-in-voxels" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>v1 of the Juicebar was built as a home for Banny, the iconic blunt-smoking banana mascot of Juicebox. It was also home to the Juicebox Learning Center, a juicy and playful institution where visitors could watch videos about the protocol, learn terms in the glossary, and participate in ongoing JB events. This tropical parcel quickly became an oasis for long-time Banny devotees and newcomers alike to learn more about the crypto crowdfunding protocol that enables anyone to fund the “thing” of their dreams on Ethereum.</p><p>As part of the growing bannyverse, <a href="https://juicebox.money/#/p/wagmistudios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WAGMI Studios</a> and <a href="https://juicebox.money/#/p/lexicondevils" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lexicon Devils</a> organized the first ever JB metaverse treasure hunt with clues that make up a seed phrase… <em>but only with the help of a decoder</em>. Prizes included 200,000 $JBX and a treasure chest filled with dope NFTs.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The Bannyverse Treasure Hunt" src="/assets/images/treasure-hunt-1167f5e592c9ccd2c937eda8dfb94cc7.jpg" width="6661" height="2386" class="img_ev3q"></p><p class="subtitle">The Bannyverse Treasure Hunt</p><p>Since October 2021, the Juicebox plot in Voxels has gone through many iterations as a center for learning, discovery, and entertainment. It stands out from surrounding parcels with its attention to detail and references to IRL architecture and design. Through pixelated curves and large windows blending the inside and outside, the current <a href="http://juicebox.lexicondevils.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicebox v2 build</a> combines characteristics of mid-century modern design with a tropical Banny aesthetic.

It was a re-discovery of a passion and realizing that it can produce value.</em></p><p>— Wackozacco</p></blockquote><p>Whether referencing the physical world or playing with what defies reality, Voxels and other metaverses allow for architects to focus on design and function rather than costs, materials, or bureaucratic mazes like zoning laws. Anyone is able to learn to build in the metaverse, regardless of their education or previous knowledge of architecture. Coming from a wide range of backgrounds, the team at <a href="https://juicebox.money/#/p/lexicondevils" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lexicon Devils</a> has spent the last year creating metaverse experiences and custom builds for other orgs, all while managing their treasury on Juicebox.</p><blockquote><p><em>If you had asked me in January 2020, I couldn’t have anticipated where I am today with my friends.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Do you want to know the surefire way to build a DAO with a small, strong community? It’s easy. Just start with a DAO with a large, strong community!</p><p>Okay, all kidding aside, if you are serious about venturing into the worlds of DAO creation, read on to learn some tips and tricks to ensure that your DAO delivers on its full potential!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="build-a-community">Build a community<a class="hash-link" href="#build-a-community" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Whether your DAO is doing NFT minting, creating tokens for governance, bringing together a global community around a shared goal or interest, or just there to further some unique idea of yours, you’re going to need a community. The problem? Not all communities are created equal, and many of them struggle to find their footing in the hustle and bustle of web3.</p><p>Finding good community members isn’t easy, but keeping them in the long run can be even harder. If your DAO has no way to compensate good community members or suffers from lack of coordinate or mission-alignment issues, you will likely find qualified people sticking around briefly and moving on. Consider thinking carefully about your mission and about a way to make it enthralling for new members. Sell the idea, and show how that idea will benefit your contributors or the planet at large. Don’t be afraid to say no, and have your mission well thought-out before you open a discord and start trying to attract new members.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="decide-on-governance-that-works-now">Decide on governance that works NOW<a class="hash-link" href="#decide-on-governance-that-works-now" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Many different <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/great-web3-governance-at-a-glance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">governance</a> systems exist, including 1-member-1-vote, quadratic voting, voting-by-tokens-held, and many more. Think carefully about how you’d like your own DAO to operate. Do you want everyone to have equal participation and inclusion? Then perhaps one-member-one-vote is the way to go. Or do you want certain members to have voting power because they are part of a core group? Do you want votes to pass with a 51% majority, or higher?</p><p>These are all important questions to consider. If you want a DAO that is more resistant to change, you may consider putting a voting threshold very high, for instance around 75% or above. This would ensure that only when the vast majority of your members agree on something that it will change.</p><p>If you want your DAO to morph quickly with changing times, you may decide to drop your voting threshold lower than 50%. This can also open you open to having your DAO hijacked by an influx of new members, so beware!</p><p>Regarding votes, how do you want people’s voting power to be represented? If you want to vote by tokens-held, then you are effectively allowing the wealthy to have greater voting power than the less wealthy. There is an argument here that the wealthy, who have invested the most in your project, deserve more voting power because they have more to lose. But new members entering your project may feel like voting is futile if they are eclipsed by others with outized voting power.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dont-be-afraid-to-adapt-as-you-scale-up">Don’t be afraid to adapt as you scale up<a class="hash-link" href="#dont-be-afraid-to-adapt-as-you-scale-up" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Consider what system you need right now, and be open to changing it. Regarding governance: If you are a small community with a core team, you may say that one-member-one-vote is the way to go. Do what makes sense at the time. If your project grows and you see another voting mechanism being more fruitful, go through the motions and suggest a change. Voting mechanisms are not set in stone, and shouldn’t be. Your DAO needs to adapt with the changing circumstances it finds itself in.</p><p>Regarding your discord server, Telegram or other service, consider changing it as your needs change. If your discord channels end up getting outdated, don’t be afraid to archive them. If your new members are getting lost in the onboarding process, consider adapting your process to be more open to new faces. Remember that by the time you start to grow, your DAO will be something you start to understand much more easily than a new member just coming in. It’s easy to lose sight of that perspective, so keep in mind to keep it simple and direct.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="and-most-importantly">And most importantly…<a class="hash-link" href="#and-most-importantly" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Have fun! You are engaging in something new, and in a great human experiment! Issues around governance have plagued humanity for thousands of years, and now with the advent of blockchain technology we have yet another style of governance to play with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Governance, that age-old question]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="governance-that-age-old-question">Governance, that age-old question<a class="hash-link" href="#governance-that-age-old-question" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>How humans govern themselves is a problem that nobody has solved. For thousands of years civilizations have attempted to crack this pesky conundrum, and arguably we’ve gotten a bit better at it. But has anyone truly solved governance? When we look at the instability in our history, it’s hard to say we have.</p><p>With blockchain and decentralization, a new movement has emerged to try to demonstrate what proper governance can look like. The <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/daolicious-tips-for-starting-your-first-dao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DAO</a>, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is one of many new attempts to organize human beings in a way that is conducive to efficiently and happiness. <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/the-power-of-tokenomics-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tokenomics</a>— a unique staple in web3 organizations— potentially hold the power to reinvent governance as we know it. So what’s the best system?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="community-as-the-core-of-great-governance">Community as the core of great governance<a class="hash-link" href="#community-as-the-core-of-great-governance" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The short answer is: we don’t know. There are still total intangibles to governance that seem to elude our planning. Let’s take a look at the United States’ governance as an example.</p><p>Many people will point to the United States, a representative democracy, as an example of an effective governance system. Consider, however, that early on in the forming of that government, the first president, George Washington, was given free reign to control the government as he saw fit. He could have declared himself a king, and in fact it was his completely voluntary precedents that determined much of how the government matured in subsequent years.</p><p>Most people would agree that this kind of noble behavior is what shaped the United States toward democracy, and that Washington single-handedly could have given himself supreme power but chose not to. So this begs the question: how do we find the George Washington’s in web3? Where are the builders who will willingly take a back seat to allow an organization to grow?</p><p>And this is where community comes into play. A strong community with shared values and interests is one way to ensure that your members will look out for one another. George Washington has just gone through a war, and was thinking of what great sacrifices took place so that this new government could form. He was surrounded by soldiers and generals and statesmen who had gone through something similar. His incentive was to improve community, not hijack it.</p><p>What does the web3 analogue look like? That’s hard to say. A quick look at some of <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/juicebox-the-token-minting-powerhouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicebox</a>’s governance systems will show why we believe that are some tangibles, however, that can point you in the right direction.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="transparency-is-key">Transparency is key<a class="hash-link" href="#transparency-is-key" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>web3 is paradoxical in more ways than one. Perhaps at its core, however, is the idea that transparency is key. No backdoor deals, and everything can can be audited if one wishes.</p><p>This system dovetails with the themes of trustlessness we see all over blockchain discussions. If I’m regularly doing backroom deals, in the traditional world I would need your trust to let me keep doing that. How do you know I’m not abusing that trust? You don’t. In the web3 world, I have to have my dealings out in the open. Now, I don’t care if you trust me or not, because you can freely look at what I’m doing and, if it’s inappropriate, you can simple call attention to that.</p><p>Does this always work? No, of course not. But does it go a far way to establishing a shared value system? Yes. If everything is open, including payout distributions, proposals for how to change something, or partnership deals, then likely everyone will be on the same page about it. It also gives opportunity for structured disagreements, where hard questions can be asked.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bringing-it-all-together">Bringing it all together<a class="hash-link" href="#bringing-it-all-together" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>If anybody promises you that they have a system for finding the “George Washingtons” in your governance, run the other way. There is no sure-fire way to find the intangibles. What you can do, however, is structure your governance in a way that scares away the bad actors. Remember that your fifth columns only work when there are shadows, concealment, and graft at play. When you shine a bright light on everything, suddenly the environment is less conducive to trickery and value-misalignment (whether pernicious or well-intentioned). Keep that light shining bright, and don’t be afraid to speak your mind. You owe it to yourself and to your governance-compatriots.</p><p>Want more?

I can’t wait to get started on my accounting!” We get it. You have a passion, and it’s probably not in making an accounts payable/receivable department.</p><p>But here’s the thing: how your <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/daolicious-tips-for-starting-your-first-dao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DAO</a>, business or non-profit treats its capital is <em>absolutely</em> an essential factor to its long-term success. Ironically, decisions around precisely these kinds of mechanisms, that lead to long-term success, tend to be back-burner relegated in the creation process of a new project. With <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/juicebox-the-token-minting-powerhouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicebox</a>: not anymore.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-the-big-deal-about-a-programmable-treasury-anyways">What’s the big deal about a programmable treasury, anyways?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-the-big-deal-about-a-programmable-treasury-anyways" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>This is an excellent question, and one that everyone should be asking themselves. Let’s pitch it this way: you know how a business usually has at least one person who does the accounting? That person tracks who gets paid, where maintenance fees go, they print checks and keep records, determine and execute changes in pay structure, on top of a bunch of other things?</p><p>Well imagine if you could save yourself that salary, and get complete control over the decision making of that department, without having to give yourself a crash course in accounting? That’s what the Juicebox programmable treasury delivers. It allows you to easily set payouts, determine where new funds go, how they are connected to tokens which, by the way, are also minted at your discretion. It puts all that power in your hands, without asking you to take on another full-time job, or pay out another full-time salary, saving you capital when you need it most.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="keeping-your-passion-where-it-belongs">Keeping your passion where it belongs<a class="hash-link" href="#keeping-your-passion-where-it-belongs" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The Juicebox programmable treasury comes with a full suite of tooling that is easy to use and implement. It allows you to set your project up in a way that suits your needs. Importantly, it also allows you to keep your passion and inspiration on the thing that matters most: your project. No other web3 creation platform has the kind of functionality and fidelity of tooling that Juicebox offers, nor does any other platform have such a rich online community willing to help project creators every step of the way. The onboarding process at Juicebox is thorough and meant to help you make concrete your project idea to ensure the greatest chance of future success.

Starting a web3 business and you need to track your accounts payable/receivable? Juicebox can do that. Starting a nonprofit where you want to reward members with tokens for governance and participation? Juicebox can do that, too. Don’t quite know what you want to create, but you know you want a project that executes on-chain and has more tooling than anybody else in the game? Juicebox has you covered.</p><p>There are few web3 platforms out there that can help you create your own project and DAO, but none of them can do it with the ease and tooling that Juicebox can. Juicebox provides users with a platform to raise money, either as a one-time or on a recurring basis, all while also offering a suit of tokenomics tooling and token minting. If you don’t want tokens, no problem, you can use Juicebox like a simple programmable treasury to track donations, payments, profits (or “overflow” as you’ll come to learn), in a transparent and honest way. The days of opaque bookkeeping where contributors have to wonder exactly how their donations are spent are over.</p><p>Juicebox can be the backbone of a local school PTA tracking funds in and out, or it can (and has!) run multi-million dollar operations. It scales effortlessly and gives you tooling to create rich token-based voting economies, as well.</p><p>Perhaps most unique is Juicebox’s approach to what it calls “overflow”, which is money raised above your target amount. This money, which otherwise may be called “profit” and traditionally may go to executive payrolls or reinvestment, sits in a treasury and can be claimed by any holders of your token. The proportional claim of the treasury a token holder receives is completely set by you using a variety of tooling, and it incentivizes anyone participating in your project to want to see its success. It’s a great way to build a mission-aligned team and, should your project find success, it’s a way to effortlessly, transparently, and efficiently reward your team members and contributors.</p><p>Want more?

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tokens-a-utility-you-shouldnt-go-without">Tokens, a utility you shouldn’t go without<a class="hash-link" href="#tokens-a-utility-you-shouldnt-go-without" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Arguably one of the most core aspects of web3 projects is the ability to mint, disburse and track tokens for your project. Token management is an area that every builder in the web3 space should take full advantage of; unfortunately, it’s also amongst the most neglected tools by new project creators.</p><p>At <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/juicebox-the-token-minting-powerhouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicebox</a>, we’ve created a robust and granular token management system that makes token management accessible for our project creators. We’ll delve into this tooling, along with the power of tokens in general. Read on the learn more!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="governance-and-so-much-more">Governance and so much more<a class="hash-link" href="#governance-and-so-much-more" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>One crucial aspect of token minting is how they relate to governance systems within <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/dalicious-tips-for-starting-your-first-dao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DAOs</a>s. While you may or may not be creating a DAO, you should keep in mind that these very same governance systems can also be used informally to gauge your stakeholder interests in an effective and efficient way.</p><p>You can choose to give tokens at your own discretion, or set certain metrics and tokenomic tooling to automatically generate and disburse tokens based on contributions made to your project. The Juicebox difference is in the rich tooling our platform provides project creators.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-lifecycle-of-a-token-built-on-the-juicebox-protocol">The lifecycle of a token built on the Juicebox protocol<a class="hash-link" href="#the-lifecycle-of-a-token-built-on-the-juicebox-protocol" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>How a token is used within the Juicebox protocol varies on a number of different factors and project creator settings. Let’s take a look at one particular path to help give you some insight into the lifecycle of an average token.</p><p>You’ve created a project, and you’ve set a distribution limit (how much funding your project needs in a given time frame to keep the lights on). Let’s say that every two weeks your project needs to be bringing in $5,000. That amount will cover the costs of the team and any other expenses to keep your project running smoothly.</p><p>Now let’s say somebody comes along and puts $2000 into your project. In exchange for contributing those funds, they get some amount of tokens (how many is completely determined by you). Furthermore, you may want to keep some tokens every time someone contributes funds, so you set something called a <em>reserved rate</em>, which is what percentage of tokens you keep. Let’s say you do 10%. So now 10% of all tokens created goes back to your project and sits in a treasury.</p><p>Now fast forward. Many more people have contributed to your project, and at this point your distribution limit is still $5000 every two weeks, but on average you’re taking in a lot more than that. All those extra funds sit in your treasury. Those “extra” funds are called your <em>overflow</em>.</p><p>Now let’s say one of your early investors, who has a lot of tokens for your project, wants to move on and get rid of his tokens. Rather than simply ignoring them, he can claim a percent of the overflow in your treasury proportional to how many tokens he has. If he has a lot of tokens, even though he may have initially just given you $2000 in funding, his tokens could be traded in for far more than that if your overflow is sufficiently large.</p><p>What’s unique about this system is that it incentivizes contributors to your project to 1) stick around, and 2) to be actively invested in your success. Some people will never be interested in trading in tokens; they may see more utility in using the tokens for governance, or simply hanging on to them as a trophy and receipt of their contributions to you. However, for those who are hoping to eventually cash out with more than they invested, the token redeeming exchange allows for this scenario if your project has become sufficiently successful.</p><p>Let’s say that first investor burns all his tokens, and gets back $3000. He’s made a profit of one thousand dollars. By redeeming the tokens, he has taken them out of circulation and they have been destroyed. He’s made $1000 in the exchange, and you managed to attract an investor early on when you needed funding more.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="an-overview-of-juicebox-tooling">An overview of Juicebox tooling<a class="hash-link" href="#an-overview-of-juicebox-tooling" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Where Juicebox really shines is in its ability to give project creators full control over the tooling they wish to employ in their projects. There is a rich help section along with a glossary on info.juicebox.money, but for a brief overview read on to learn some of the basics.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="distribution-limit">Distribution Limit<a class="hash-link" href="#distribution-limit" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The easiest way to think of this is by answering this question: how many funds do you need to keep the lights on for your project, and how frequently do you need them? Do you have a dev team that needs to be paid, or server hosting fees, a content writer, etc.? Whatever those costs amount to will tell you the amount of funds you need to keep your project stable and going forward.</p><p>Do you need $2000 every two weeks? $1000 every ten days? $5000 a month? Whatever time and amount you need is what you will declare as your “distribution limit” when you create a JB project.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="overflow">Overflow<a class="hash-link" href="#overflow" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>If your project receives more funds than you declared in your distribution limit, those extra funds will sit in a treasury. These extra funds are called overflow. Token holders can at any time redeem their tokens (trade in their tokens) for a portion of the value of overflow in your project. If your project has huge overflow because it has become very successful, then token holders can get a piece of that success by redeeming their tokens.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reserve-rate">Reserve Rate<a class="hash-link" href="#reserve-rate" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The reserve rate is what percentage of tokens you keep every time you mint tokens. You can set this anywhere from zero to one hundred percent or in between. Setting a reserve rate allows your project to accrue tokens. Not having a reserve rate means that all tokens you mint will go to contributors.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="redemption-rate">Redemption Rate<a class="hash-link" href="#redemption-rate" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The redemption rate is something you set that determines how much value redeemed tokens will have based on when they are redeemed. If somebody redeems their tokens right away, they will get less proportional overflow value than someone who waits until later to redeem their tokens. A redemption rate incentivizes people to stick around as your project grows, and it disincentivizes investors who are just looking to make a quick buck. You can set an aggressive or weak redemption rate, or none at all, when you create a Juicebox project.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="weight">Weight<a class="hash-link" href="#weight" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The term <em>weight</em> simply means how many tokens or other assets, such as NFTs, a contributor will receive for a set amount of contribution. For instance, a contributor who puts $1000 into your project may receive a million tokens (if you so choose).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="burning-versus-redeeming-tokens">Burning versus Redeeming tokens<a class="hash-link" href="#burning-versus-redeeming-tokens" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Whenever someone gives back their tokens, those tokens are destroyed permanently. If a token holder gives back tokens for a share of the overflow, we call this “redeeming” the tokens. Let’s say, however, that there is no overflow. In that case, the tokens are still traded in and destroyed, but they don’t yield any value back. When this happens, we call it “burning” tokens.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together<a class="hash-link" href="#putting-it-all-together" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The importance of JB really sits with the excellent tooling suite you receive by using it. Regarding pricing, JB takes 2.5% of all funds raised on a project. In exchange for that you receive the JB tooling and use of the protocol which gives you a no-code solution to your web3 needs.</p><p>Want more?

My boyfriend’s sister owned a little sundry shop which just went outta business so they had groceries for free! Yesterday we went and got like 700 bucks worth of bougie groceries. I have a big thing for frozen burritos.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="haha-im-reminded-of-the-story-of-the-plumber-in-france-people-are-standing-at-the-cathedral-admiring-the-art-and-architecture-and-the-plumber-just-wants-to-go-into-the-catacombs-to-see-how-they-laid-and-routed-their-pipes-you-can-have-anything-and-yet-the-frozen-burrito-seems-to-be-the-winner">Haha. I’m reminded of the story of the plumber in France. People are standing at the cathedral admiring the art and architecture, and the plumber just wants to go into the catacombs to see how they laid and routed their pipes. You can have anything, and yet the frozen burrito seems to be the winner!<a class="hash-link" href="#haha-im-reminded-of-the-story-of-the-plumber-in-france-people-are-standing-at-the-cathedral-admiring-the-art-and-architecture-and-the-plumber-just-wants-to-go-into-the-catacombs-to-see-how-they-laid-and-routed-their-pipes-you-can-have-anything-and-yet-the-frozen-burrito-seems-to-be-the-winner" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In addition to everything else! I also like frozen chicken nuggets, which I’m actually eating right now.

I would never buy frozen chicken nuggets, but they were there so I figured I may as well grab them. The bougiest thing I got was, hmm…  I got a free thing of 15 dollar fig pomegranate jam.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="you-know-i-was-once-gifted-a-40-dollar-peanut-butter-jar">You know, I was once gifted a 40 dollar peanut butter jar.<a class="hash-link" href="#you-know-i-was-once-gifted-a-40-dollar-peanut-butter-jar" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Holy shit.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="actually-by-a-jb-contributor-do-you-want-to-guess-who">Actually by a JB contributor— do you want to guess who?<a class="hash-link" href="#actually-by-a-jb-contributor-do-you-want-to-guess-who" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Hmm, filipv?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="filipv-yes">Filipv, yes!<a class="hash-link" href="#filipv-yes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>He buys 40 dollar jars of peanut butter?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="he-claims-he-got-it-as-a-gift-i-feel-kinda-guilty-opening-it-truth-be-told">He claims he got it as a gift… I feel kinda guilty opening it truth be told…<a class="hash-link" href="#he-claims-he-got-it-as-a-gift-i-feel-kinda-guilty-opening-it-truth-be-told" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In what world could a bottle of PB be worth 40 dollars?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="haha-i-looked-up-the-brand-it-was-a-nice-hipstery-kind-of-homepage-lots-of-flowery-language-but-when-i-delved-in-i-saw-the-process-was-exactly-the-same-i-mean-its-just-mashing-peanuts">Haha.

It was a similar analogy to JB— a fountain creates overflow. So I was doing a lot of drawings of fountains at first, not full time but juat when I had a chance. Then they decided to change the name to “JuiceBox” and then it started to get really fun. We were spit balling about how web3 is kind of outlawish and definitely not mainstream, so we started thinking about juice, fruit, and little punk fruit, and that turned into Banny being a weird little coding BDSM banana.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-always-wondered-about-the-chokers">I always wondered about the chokers…<a class="hash-link" href="#i-always-wondered-about-the-chokers" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Yeah!

I was a ballet dancer for 18 years, I did a lot of ballet and pointe work— that was fun. I’m really bad at like listening/remembering dance moves and routines/sequences, so I wasn’t ever super competitive but I enjoyed it a lot.

Burtula is making super sick backgrounds and animations. You’re writing amazing backstories for all the bannies! Tank and Natasha are building and making the site awesome! And Mieos is doing a killer job directing everything! I can’t wait to launch the site and for everyone to meet and make all the hilarious bannies we’ve got in store!</p><p>Another thing on a IRL level, maybe when gas prices go down, is that my boyfriend and I are planning to take our van out to do a tour and go see some friends in Utah and Idaho and Oregon, and do a dirtbiking trip. It’ll probably go for like a month, but we have some work to do on the van first. The best thing about working for JB is that I can do these things because I work remotely.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Front end updates with @aeolian and @peri]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="front-end-updates-with-aeolian-and-peri">Front end updates with @aeolian and @peri<a class="hash-link" href="#front-end-updates-with-aeolian-and-peri" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><strong>@aeolian</strong>: It has been a while since we gave an update, quick couple of housekeeping things on what Peel's up to. So for the last few funding Cycles, we've been operating in two experiments, which has been really great. These align with the Juicebox funding Cycles, I'll drop a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/jbx-protocol/projects/1/views/20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> in the town hall chat for those who haven't seen it before. So we're basically scheduling issues every two weeks that is aligned with the JuiceboxDAO funding cycle. And I think what we're going to plan to do is to give a recap of the previous funding cycle every two weeks. So next week, we'll give a recap of all the stuff that was done in the last two weeks, which is going to be really really great this time around there's been so much done. So definitely don't want to miss that. </p><p>I want to highlight one quick fun feature. That was merged yesterday. So this is the ability to add Banny stickers to Memos, which is a small thing, but potentially a fun feature which some of you have been enjoying. So thank you for everyone who worked on that particularly JohnnyD who led the implementation. Check <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnnyD_eth/status/1536600334507843586" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JohnnD's twitter</a> for a video demo of this.</p><p>There's four big things in flight at the moment. And I'll list them out in order of the time that they'll be shipped more or less. </p><ol><li>The first is giving projects the ability to relaunch on V2 and giving token holders the ability to migrate their tokens to the V2 project.</li><li>Second is V2 project handles, which is being led by Peri. Right now projects on V2 don't have handles like they did in V1 so that is adding support for those. </li><li>The third is NFT rewards for projects. Essentially it's giving projects the ability to specify like if you contribute a certain amount of funds to this project, then we will reward you with an NFT. So that's going to be really exciting giving projects another avenue to get funding which is great. </li><li>And then the fourth is obviously veBanny and staking.</li></ol><p>So I will quicking give an overview of what's in store with V1 V2 migration, basically we need to give V1 projects the ability to relaunch on V2. So the canonical example is juiceboxDAO. We're a V1 projects. We also now have a V2 project but none of our funds are in the V2 project.</p><p>What's gonna happen is the projects will re-launch on V2, JuiceboxDAO has already done that so we have a project on V2. They're then gonna move their whole balance to the V2 project. They're going to add another payment terminal to the V2 project, and this is a special payment terminal where it'll accept a V1 token and then return the V2 token in a 1:1 exchange rate.</p><p>So basically if I have Juicebox V1 token, there'll be a place in the interface to go to swap my V1 tokens for the new V2 tokens. And that's pretty much it. So the contracts are more or less done. Thank you to jango Dr.Gorilla and whoever else worked on that. That was really quick turnaround. And now it's pretty much up to the front end to get the UI done for all of what I just explained. And then we'll finally have upgrade path to some V1 projects to get on V2 and use all the cool new stuff. </p><p><strong>@peri</strong>: I think as everybody knows we still aren't supporting project handles for the new V2 projects. And this is basically just has to do with some of the changes that are made in the contracts. We used to store a handle for a project on chain and it requires a lot of extra finessing in the contracts because we had to make sure that people can use the same contract and that handles could be transferred and reserved for certain period of time and claimed, there's a lot of functionalities to bake in. So with the V2 project contracts, we just skipped over all that because it ended up not being very necessary for the functionality of the contracts themselves. But the downside of course is that it's really nice to have in the app to be able to look up projects and search for projects.</p><p>So we've been working on another layer, another contract to add into the existing contracts that will support handles for V2 projects. It is not quite finished and it's not on mainnet yet.  But we do have everything kind of functionally together so I can give a demo of how it'll work in the app and explain how it works pretty quickly.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/njwILOI-d2fd6e7b5384dbdd906a0c382e8540e1.png" width="1280" height="1438" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><em>(screen sharing ongoing)</em></p><p>So I've got this empty project here on Rinkeby, ID 4117.  And we are going to set a handle for this project. </p><p>We've got a two-transaction-process for setting a project handle. And so the way that this works is we decided to use ENS names to handle the uniqueness of project handles what I mentioned earlier for making sure that handles be passed around and exchanged. There's a lot of complexity there that ENS has already solved really beautifully and so we built the system around ENS names. The idea here is that if you want to use a handle for a project you will need to own the matching ENS name. So for example, I just got this ENS name on rinkby testinginprod.eth and this would allow me to set the handle of this project to testinginprod. So I'm gonna do two steps here,</p><ol><li>I have to own this ENS name first of course,  I'm going to set the ENS name testinginprod.eth and this would be one transaction. Once this completes, step one will be done.</li><li>The next step here is to actually set a text record on the ENS name. So if anybody's used the ENS name app before you'll know that you can come down and set these text records for any number of different things. We are using a particular key "Juicebox project ID". You can come and set this property in the ENS name app manually if you want, but that's a little bit of extra work. So we've made it nice, pretty and clean in the app and you can basically come down here and click this button and we're gonna set that value in the ENS name text record to the ID of this project. So this one is 4117. So I'm going to send this transaction, which is the same as if I just came over here and just manually put 4117 here. That'll show up here if you got the handle set up.</li></ol><p>Most importantly that'll allow your project to be searched on the projects page. Right now the search bar works by searching for project handles and V2 projects don't have handles you can't search for them. It's very lame that is now a thing of the past as soon as you set a handle for your project. Your project will be searchable. </p><p>An important thing to note is that either of these things change, for example if you were to transfer the ENS name and someone else changes that text record, your handle will go back to empty. So you have to have both of these things set constantly or if you were to change this to some other ENS name, your handle would go back to empty.</p><p>Another fun fact is you can also actually do subdomains here. </p><p>We will hopefully have that on mainnet this week. I'm pretty sure we're doing. some just some last-minute things, but mostly everything is good to go. So expect it pretty soon. </p><p><strong>@0xSTVG:</strong> So does that mean that I could create multiple projects with subdomains of my ENS?</p><p><strong>@peri</strong>: You could. But you can't have multiple projects using the same ENS name. So if you had like STVG.eth, and you want to do like one project one.STVG.eth and the other project two.STVG.eth, those could be two separate handles for different projects.</p><p>@mieos: Once we get that up and running, I think a screen recording of you going through that or WAGMI can put together a little infographic on what it is and how it works, especially when it gets up to the subdomain part, it's just technical enough. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="vebanny-by-jmill">veBanny by @Jmill<a class="hash-link" href="#vebanny-by-jmill" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I want to show a map with the veBanny stuff. I've been doing some work on the subgraph implementation to index the user tokens and interact with them. Right now we had a couple of big steps forward. One thing is there's now a metadata file to parse for all the the characters or the variants so you can go through and scroll through the characters and figure out which one you want and then you can see them all in here, too. So that's been a nice upgrade because you can pull that all from one place now.</p><p><em>(screen sharing ongoing)</em></p><p>So these are NFT positions that I've taken on this account. So you like lock positions that are actually coming from on chain. And then you can interact with them also, so I can do that to extend the lock or I can unlock the ones that have finished. So I can take this one and extend the lock like a thousand days. Then it takes a minute for the graph to re-index it, but it'll show up 30 seconds later with the new lockdate.</p><p>And then other than that I showed this last week, we have a new contract where you can mint for one second just like test the unlock and redeem stuff. But yeah, I showed this on the last demo where you can  also like take a staking position and actually mint these things through the front end works also. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="quizz-time">quizz time:<a class="hash-link" href="#quizz-time" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/AME442G-b0e7abeb37a8aa055a5a588739f9df56.png" width="954" height="515" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The answer is....</p><p><strong>Nicholas</strong></p><ul><li>As a student I made jewelry and garment. </li><li>I was a nationally ranked debater.</li><li>I haven't been Malta before.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="nft-update-by-johnnyd">NFT update by @JohnnyD<a class="hash-link" href="#nft-update-by-johnnyd" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><strong>@JohnnyD</strong>: I'll just add a few sentences to what @aeolian has summarized before. We're gonna be automatically rewarding contributors NFTs when they contribute above a certain amount. and then the next step will be adding a restriction around, such as time restrictions so ensuring that those NFTs are distributed only before a certain funding cycle. But for now, we're just going with the amounts. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="announcement-from-briley">Announcement from @briley<a class="hash-link" href="#announcement-from-briley" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><strong>@briley</strong>: Yeah, thanks. I was just gonna make a small announcement that Matthew and I are recording podcast episode with lexicon Devils on Thursday if you have any questions that you would like to ask you can let us know. Otherwise, we'll be doing that in advance of the JB MorganStern's voxel slash IRL event.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>“Juicebox in the words of” is a series that highlights JB community members in interview form. Learn about members’ roles at JB and what makes them tick.</em></p><p><em>JohnnyD is a front-end dev and a core member of the Peel Team. His work is plainly visible on our website, where he takes an active role both in the front-end code and, increasingly, in the design elements of the website. How visual architecture complements site tooling and functionality are an area of great interest and focus for him. Recently, he’s been on the road with Zeugh at a couple of conferences, and by the time I caught up to him was traveling solo across Europe. Read on to learn a bit about his origin story, interests and future aspirations!</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="greetings-i-know-youre-in-the-midst-of-traveling-thank-you-for-taking-the-time-hows-it-been-going">Greetings!

It’s been really good. Some good wins, we think, and some good projects to follow up on. We learned a lot about how to communicate our value proposition and got a lot of good stuff.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-important-heres-the-million-dollar-question-what-have-you-found-is-the-ideal-way-to-communicate-jbs-value-proposition">So important.

I think it’s really important to fish out what a project wants and what needs we’re there to give them. From there we’ll know what JB features that’ll help them the most— whether that be transparency in earning/spending, or the ease of launching an ERC-20 token and having that distributed to people upon contributing. Or whether automating payments out of the treasury and restricting/reconfigurations of that spending are the way they want to go. Those are the key points</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="it-strikes-me-a-scalability-problem-we-seem-to-have-a-boutique-approach-at-the-moment-almost-like-a-concierge-service-as-we-expand-how-do-we-streamline-some-of-that-onboarding-without-losing-that-conversation-with-the-user">It strikes me a scalability problem.

I definitely have ideas around that; mainly I really like the idea of categorizing particular common projects/project types, like NFC Coops, straight up Web3 businesses, or the classic one-time fundraiser. I think having clear resources for these like links to pre-filled templates could be super helpful and useful. Essentially, we want people to come to the site and feel comfortable setting up a project themselves without having someone walking them through it.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="for-sure-out-of-curiosity-what-was-it-like-gallivanting-around-with-zeugh">For sure.

I think it should be a big priority of ours to present it in a more understandable way; I’m keen to make it more visible on the front-end too.

Before JB a group of friends and I started getting into NFTs and we wanted to create a DAO to be an NFT Coop, with the goal being to acquire some of the more expensive NFTs. Aeolian was one of my buddies in that NFT and he found JB and looked at the github, started working a bit on it, and told me about it. After a week or so I started doing the same. It was so exciting, I pretty much quit my job 2 weeks later and said okay, I’m doing this.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="front-end-seems-like-so-cross-disciplinary-youre-juggling-user-interfacedesign-along-with-coding-whats-that-like">Front-end seems like so cross-disciplinary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Warning of Influx of new members.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="warning-of-influx-of-new-members">Warning of Influx of new members.<a class="hash-link" href="#warning-of-influx-of-new-members" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><strong>filipv</strong>: On June 7^th^, the Discord server of JuiceboxDAO was faced with a big influx of new members from Indonesia. According to @Zeugh, they came from several big Telegram chat groups that are mainly focused on airdrops. There might be a misintrepretation that if they create a project on rinkeby.juicebox.money and give feedback in the Discord server, they will be entitiled to some kind of Juicebox airdrop. <strong>We don't have any airdrop currently.</strong></p><p><strong>Zeugh</strong>： I think it won't do any substantial harm to JuiceboxDAO, and think it a great opportunity to showcase the functionalities of our protocol to these people, and to onboard some new members who are really interested in our products.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="vebanny-front-end-updates-by-jmill">veBanny Front End updates by @Jmill<a class="hash-link" href="#vebanny-front-end-updates-by-jmill" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><strong>Jmill</strong>: I have been working pretty extensively on the veBanny front end, trying to get it out the door. Now that the contracts are deployed, we can work to transactions and use real data.</p><p>(<em>sharing screen and demonstrating the process of staking tokens for an Locked NFT</em>)</p><p>So we're now minting this thing through the website which is cool. The stuff is all working now, and show up pretty cool.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: I've also been on the contract side of things that @Viraz has been doing a great job, asking for reviews over the tests. The tests he's writing and adding more fuzzing tests to the suite. So hopefully at this point, it's throwing a lot of use cases at the cocept. And i suppose it'll make way on to the actual final details to complete the workflow.</p><p><strong>Jmill</strong>: The big thing next is to read the onchain data and get the use of NFT, and then allow them to extend their locked positions on a particular NFT. All of those are related to fetching data, about multiple tokens. We're talking about this in Peel's Discord, and right now it's implemented as ERC-721 Enumerable, but it'll probably be easier if it were structured similiar with Juicebox projects where you have a directory structure and subgraph, to look that information up without recursive calls to open by index. So that's probably what we need to start thinking about how we index these information for the purpose of front end to grab it and work with the data. </p><p><strong>jango</strong>: Yeah, that makes sense. Also from a juiceboxDAO or Juicebox perspective in Juicebox.money, we'll possibly first have to deploy their staking contract and specify the lock duration they want etc. It isn't going to be there for everyone first, they have to specify those things, so that that initial transaction to deploy a staking contract will go through a contract that somewhat serve as a directory or at least it'll file an event that's indexable to service a directory. If Peel and Juicebox.money feel it a decent thing to offer all projects over time and they should be able to interact with that same depolyer contract to get their own version of this.</p><p><strong>filipv</strong>:What's the timeline looking like? Is that somehting we can expect deploying in the next month?</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: We need V1 &gt; V2 migration to do it for JuiceboxDAO. We can deploy this for an arbitrary project though. We can launch a new project and just has it work there, so you can start minting stuff, just as normal treasury and lock it there, at which point there's not much difference between test and rinkeby as we currently are. But to get the JuiceboxDAO version of this and the Bannyverse version at least from a ecosystem perspective, we need to get V1 &gt; V2 migration, and then there might be other technical things along the way.</p><p><strong>Jmill</strong>: From a front end perspective, there are a couple of things that would be helpful so that there's some kind of indexing data you can easily pull user's NFT statistics. That's a more simple and scalable way to do with subgraph query. It would be really usefull if the ve NFT contract deployer also deploy a single consolidated metadata file. Let's say veBanny has 60 characters and they all have a name and staking ranges, it'll be really nice that the contract generate that as one file that front end could grab and parse to display without going to 60 metadata files individually. That would be a quality-of-life thing from the contract side for the front end.</p><p><strong>tankbottoms</strong>: We could add another function for that metadata, basically something that will conform with an NFT but also has pointers to all assets you need, because you can pick them through the JSONs however you want.</p><p><strong>Jmill</strong>: The last item I have here is that we're implementing beneficiary for this, so that users can stake and put someone else as the beneficiary.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: That'll be useful for even a DAO to lock its supply, and designate other contributor or some other beneficiary for. It's cool to have flexibility. The core thing being built allows everyone on the peripheral of the project to start to wrap their heads around what situation it's gonna be when this thing is out there.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="product-prospective-with-zeugh">Product prospective with @Zeugh<a class="hash-link" href="#product-prospective-with-zeugh" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/ktQrGSS-a6a1f2e23428f4842bea76122e9ce4af.png" width="1830" height="698" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>Zeugh</strong>: The Juicebox.money is a complex thing to use. I think it will be something to see that front end are more focused on some type of projects. Let's say there's a NFT project wants to launch its treasury on Juicebox, they can have a direct way for easy launch to help set it up ahead of time. You want to launch a NFT project and make the funds through Juicebox so people can co-own the treasury like tileDAO did and issue tokens for people that are minting.</p><p>Those are some of the configurations that we think we should do. That could be something like Juicebox.nft instead of Juicebox.money. And if you want to go to the hard mode and be able to configure every single thing, that's still running on the same protocol.</p><p>That's what I call the product prospective. We have a very good protocol perspective here that is building something really robust and can do lots of things. In the end looking at product level, maybe not all the users will need all of these things and having an easy way to launch might be something interesting.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: I think there's a lot of to keep improving the onboarding stuff and especially we just came out of V2 trying to start with parity where V1 was. The name of the game now is just constant improving based on our own interest with onboarding as well as pulling together other people's perspective. It's hard to be certain that it's one thing or another thing from my point of view, but without question we're going to hinge towards better alternatives to prototypes that are massively useful. Shout out to JohnnyD and Aeolian and all the people in Peel who are eager and quick to make prototypes and start discord threads so that we can discuss the improvements. And then match this with a occasional AHA moment that a few different ideas come together that make sense to a lot of folks and somehow we unlock a lot more fluidity to the onboarding process. </p><p>I'm certainly with you that we have a lot of work to do with explaining what people are getting into, like starting with giving everyone all the information upfront and make all risks as clear as possible. Overtime we can start to reel back into some managable shortcuts. </p><p>I think now we're definitely buckling for more long term investments both from a building perspective and the relationship perspective with other communities. I'm eager to see how that project chart changes over time. I think from my personal perspective and talking to projects, the recent lows haven't been very encouraging for projects to launch. But now that V2 is out, we're going to see a lot more of that.</p><p><strong>nicholas</strong>: When I did onboarding with Austin from BuildGuild and he had some feedback about simplifying. It's a little bit difficult for someone on the outside to know exactly which simplifying approach will be successfull on the market aside from just iterating on simplifying the existing one. But I do have some suspicion that there are a larger category of people who are not so inclined to use Juicebox in its current form but might be inclined to do so for this example we're talking couple of times about NFT collections, splitting off a portion of their primary and/or secondary to Juicebox and letting the holders manage it, which doodles, cryptopunks and a bunch of other projects already do. That's a category I'm super interested in getting on the creation flow for that. It could be just like presets on what we've already got, or maybe an entirely separate creation flow where you can imagine entirely different front ends that just make creation really tight for a specific use case and then you can go use Juicebox.money's full advanced front end and subsequently managing those things but make it easier for people to get onboard. It could be pretty integrated at Juicebox.money. There's a lot to explore.</p><p><strong>filipv</strong>: One thng that we've discussed that might be interesting would be if there's a way to easily import and export project configurations which Austin Griffith originally brought up, for exporting a project that was made on testnet to mainnet. That might be cool because you can use that feature to set up templates that have base project configurations.</p><p>Another thing I want to talk about is what we're discussing a lot in the chat about amount of metrics. I'm not sure how useful focusing on any specific North Star metric would be. It's very hard to encapsulate everything in Juicebox, and I think everything is conflating with each other. So I think we can take anything and roll with it, but I don't know if it's worthy going super deep into which is the best North Star metric.</p><p><strong>Aeolian</strong>: I'm totally with @filipv. I think the goal I originally had with proposing this metric was not so much like "ok! Let's review this number every week!" or "Oh! it's going down, what's happening?" It's more like what we're all in some sense collectively optimizing for everything from a product, website, documentation and content strategy, the whole thing. Our goal right now is to increase the number of active projects. I agree with you that at this stage where traffic is still very low, really trying to hatch out a metric that's instructive right now. It's more to get us all on the same page.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: I think the general consensus is that it feels good to have activity. I guess you could put on a chart and optimize for it, but personally I want to think about metrics that make me lean in more in moment's notice seeing activities, and seeing folks I know engaging with other projects making me want to learn more about them.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="govenance-discussion">Govenance discussion<a class="hash-link" href="#govenance-discussion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><strong>@filipv</strong>: I want to open up some discussion on the recent governance cycle, both in itself and some of the proposals. </p><p>One thing I want to bring up first is the possibility of changing the governance cycle in order to allow for longer temperature checks because I definitely feel the temp check are too short. But there's also balance if you lengthen the temp check, it makes it harder to get things through the governance process and it takes longer to get things done. We did a poll and people are really into the weekday idea.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/nG8Bn2D-7b9c7c25f95d53b41aefb6272167a809.png" width="772" height="668" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>nicholas</strong>: Since people prefer temp check ends during the week, I'd particularly like the proposal edit freeze to happen during the week, because I had to spend a lot of Sundays modifying proposals because people obviously just give comments leading up to the freeze and I prefer it end in the week. I understand people have jobs and I am certain that might not be convenient, but people from the poll seem to be happy with that idea.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: For me personally, it's nice to end on weekend because I can do a lot more meeting oriented and dev oriented stuff during the week, and in the weekend, I can read the proposals and think about those. There's not much weekend breaktime.</p><p><strong>nicholas</strong>: How specified should proposals be? I made a suggestion that is three points if you add them to the proposals,
<img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/GbRQJsd-14e72c17e289c704f7e2a262f74a288e.png" width="2020" height="946" class="img_ev3q">
maybe they will enable more delegation, because a lot of the burden getting the proposal through can be like knowing exactly what steps should be taken, when it's not always necessary DAO knows every single steps if DAO is willing to accept the risks, the implementation risk of someone delegating it to the person who's the author or someone specified in the proposal. I think it's a decent choice if it's a better financial allocation and also adding a risk in risk section which is like "Look, we're not specifying the address the money got set to, we don't think that's a super important detail for the DAO to be voting on", but that's a risk we can screw up sending it to a wrong address because it wasn't specified in the proposal. It allow the proposal to move forward before all those details are sorted out. Some proposal do deserve to have hyper detailed specifications and it's important for the DAO to vote on it, others delegation will be more appropriate. I think that might be a interesting format for making governance more manageable. </p><p><strong>filipv</strong>: I'm definitely onboard with that. I think that thing need to be weighted very carefully just because it's not like we are going through a hierachy and people are revising it in every step. It's kind of like every proposal goest to the multisig like the one source of truth. It's like something running close to the middel very powerful and very dangerous. I think we need to be careful about specifications and and we don't want to lead to some DAO crisis when people are disagreeing on an interpretation of the proposal after the fact.</p><p>First of all it waste a bunch of time, also people are gonna get upset and may lead to conflicts. So I am generally more of a stickler that we should have very specific proposals just because how dangerous it is. I wonder if there is a way to incentivize people to submit a bunch of proposals earlier so they can be spread out ever a greater period of time. We really see most proposal submitted close to the end of temp check. It's not an easy question to solve.</p><p><strong>nicholas</strong>: Part of the challenge is the 14days cycle, if you would like to submit a proposal for something and temp check submission just opened, that means you  can no longer submit a proposal and you could be waiting for 20+ days till the next opportunity to vote. It may be worthwhile, for instance the bug bounty, I can see both sides on it, maybe a longer process allow us to consider, but at the same time, the protocol needs the bounty pretty badly. </p><p>I think it would be of some value not entirely in the direction of everything being specified because the reality is that just making through all of that governance and having opinions on it is stretching the limits of the bandwidth of even the most dedicated members of the DAO. It also becomes less decentralized the more because people are just voting along with other people who have already voted. There's also some needs to us to recognize that actually the DAO doesn't need to vote on every single details of everything, and some amount of delegation is probably gonna be necessary over the medium term. </p><p><strong>filipv</strong>: Two thoughts on that.</p><p>One is that I don't see why we couldn't do it right now like approving a budget in advance to reduce future governance overhead and go through that process. I think that's very achievable and I'm interested in pursuing that.</p><p>Second thought is that jango has be mentioning lately the idea of possibly pursuing funding for projects and budgets for projects rather that fuding budgets for individuals or groups, which I think compelling because the structure of what we are doing shifts a lot and it's the post V2 transitory period. So I wonder maybe a shift towards budgeting for things get done rather than having all these smaller individual small group proposals may accomplish what you are talking about being able to improve things in advance and delegates to someone who's leading the project.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: Some of the treasury allocations have also been tricky in the past weeks because we've been tuning the treasury create stuff on and off while we address some protocol problem. Those should be made well in advance in proposals being specified to be directed towards them. I am definitely in the camp of more hyper specificity upfront and throughout the temp check process.</p><p><strong>filipv</strong>: Would you want to work with Juicebox if you didn't get funding through an individual basis, but rather as a part of multiple projects?</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: The end of payment routing is still individual payout, either from a project that you control like what JohnnyD has, or through a direct payment from a project. The idea is that it's just not managed by a conglomerate governance system.</p><p><strong>felixander</strong>: I want to talk with JohnnyD and Aeolian about this. What happens when you bring a human on for a projects and the project is solved? It doesn't make sense for the system now because we've committed a budget to something that only took 2-3 months, but now somebody is there, but they're taking on another work that might be totally separating them from what they're doing. I think it's something a little bit messy in terms of how the payment structure works presently.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: I feel that kind of work is really important when a project is starting out, that's still the case now and will likely still be months into the future. There's a lot happening and everyone is contributing to whatever the next person needs. So people are just shouting "hey I got this dope thing in progress, it'd be sweet if I could have this ounce of help" and luckily there's a lot of people around who are eager and feeling supportive to do that work. So the individual payouts feel appropriate in that world.</p><p>I think that would set the expectation that there's a lot of stuff that we've building isn't just onging forever, we're not hired by JuiceboxDAO to be here comfortably and feel valued imbued and viewed by our relationship to one another and to the concept of the projects. Once those projects play themselves out, I think it's healthy to reassess what our purpose is amongst current state of the projects and how we can prepare ourselves for future state of uncertainty which are always upon us. That's the thing we can almost guarantee. </p><p><strong>felixander</strong>: Would that be the same way like Peel, WAGMI and Canu, the idea that people would branch off like Peel now is under a budget to do front end? You could imagine people who are doing docs would branch out and have a budget, and people who are doing translation would also branch off and have a budget.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: I think that's in a creative part and I'm sure everyone will bring their own taste of how to frame these things. It's effective to pay Peel to work on the Juicebox.money project, front end developers can assess each other's contributions and payouts better than any multidisciplinary group would.</p><p>These things will inevitably shift and change over time, as people come and go, as well as the projects changing. It's tougher for the community to rationalize consistent budgeting for an abtract group of people with an abtract but pointed mission, the individuals are liquid between all these project organizaitons and we hve to respect that. People are going to find their leverage over time and they don't owe anything to any organizations. We're all just building ourselves out and learning from each other in  this whole process. I think we're going to see a lot of different ways to organize it.</p><p>Shout out to Zom_Bae creating the Juicebox events version for the upcoming ice cream event and it's in a potential to add more longevity to that concept. What if we're to actually trying to fund events consistently and have a pool of resources that we can make this up every single time. We can just re-reference something that we know to be true already.</p><p>I think we're on the same page eventually. We've got to create the right incentive model to shift away from building up the Juicebox foundation to supporting one in any numbers of projects and then servie it to the world and make it the gateway. But as the protocol tends towards stability, it'll be great to have tighter articulation of what it means for a project to succeed over time.</p><p><strong>Aeolian</strong>: I do like what @casstoshi brought up about the idea of each group having a budget and individual contributors are paid from that budget. I think Peel has done this. At a time all the front end people were doing individual proposals to JuiceboxDAO and the sentiment was that it's hard to evaluate these proposals. So intead JuiceboxDAO votes on a single budget for front end and that team can handle that budget as they see fit.</p><p>I'll post a <a href="https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp68-modify-protocol-engineering-core-unit-budget-pe-001/13797" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> that Drgorilla posted earlier about how makerDAO manages this process where there's a clear budget for each abstract collecton of people. It definitely breaks down as we've seen with some proposals over the last couple of weeks. It's hard to pinpoint someone into one of those particular groups, people can work ver much across thses groups.</p><p>I still think it's instrutive not only from accounting perspective but also from an organizational perspective, it just makes it easy to reason about someone's payout if they're clearly contributing to a specific area.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-highlights">Project highlights<a class="hash-link" href="#project-highlights" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><strong>gogo</strong>: I'm very glad to be able to discover the future of ComicsDAO and strategy of what we're gonna do there. We had a super contribution from JuiceboxDAO from the beginning which is pretty amazing. </p><p>I would like to share what we just thought. So we basically are doing a full story and the beginning starts with <a href="https://twitter.com/ComicsDAO/status/1533991837865746432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post here</a>.

What I would like to propose is that this is our heroes Banny and they're travelling throught the DAO galaxy to DAOs. We would like to know where JuiceboxDAO would like the ship to go to the next DAO, so that we can keep on building covers to next DAO. Let's create a poll here and vote on the DAO that JuiceboxDAO decides what ComicsDAO is gonna do next. </p><p>Another thing is that, we had a big player, this guy is amazing and helps us a lot.

I love the treasury management, a part of which is to buy rare comics and hold thme, but the day to day potential of being the storytelling branch of differnt DAOs, which is immensely powerful. And so far you are all playing really well, well done.</p><p><strong>nicholas</strong>: There're a bunch of really cool projects this week. JokeDAO just launched a super sick governance experimentation project. </p><p>Austin Griffith's BuildGuild got launched this week and there's a proposal to fund a hackathon for them to transform scaffold-eth into something compatible with Juicebox or to build the hackathon projects using scaffold-eth with juicebox involved in the picture. And as jango mentioned in  his twitter that Juicebox front end is based on scaffold-eth. </p><p>So it's very cool to see comfort circle, and hopefully we will be able to fund a modest hackathon to get the treasury kickstarted with funds, hopefully getting that brew of hackers into the ecosystem. </p><p>@twodam's has posted a twitter about this week's projects <a href="https://twitter.com/twodam_eth/status/1534200052511518720" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

Thank you @nicholas for doing a lot. Most excited once we get the V1 V2 token stuff, situated to start talking to the SharkDAO, or a lot of folks operating on V1 still doing ongoing work and fundraising, to see if they want to move over and leverage some of the new tools to make their projects more successful, whatever that means to them these days. But I think we're still a little ways away, so getting new projects on is still the name of the game for sure.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="quizz-time">Quizz time:<a class="hash-link" href="#quizz-time" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/NHRuMkt-c65e50e8351bdbca3ee87d65543b35d6.png" width="1552" height="752" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Oh man, this episode definitely needs a PG rating for sure.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>“Juicebox in the words of” is a series that highlights JB community members in interview form. Learn about members’ roles at JB and what makes them tick.</em></p><p><em>Big Daddy Mieos is the patriarch of Wagmi studios and a certified JB OG. He’s seen Juicebox evolve from it’s very beginnings to the robust platform it is today, and he launched one of its very first projects back in the day. Meios is a gentle conductor of creative JB branding and a level-headed voice of reason within the JB community. Read on to learn a bit more about this awesome JB contributor, what he’s up to right now, and the origin story of Wagmi Studios.</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hey-mieos-whatre-you-up-to-right-now-and-whats-on-your-mind">Hey Mieos! What’re you up to right now and what’s on your mind?<a class="hash-link" href="#hey-mieos-whatre-you-up-to-right-now-and-whats-on-your-mind" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Hmm… the thing that has been occupying my attention and creativity a lot lately has been this desire to convert the greater portion of juicebox projects from these crowd-funded single-purchase projects to something more like a product or service or longer-term projects that build out and make full use of JB tooling.</p><p>It’s really also about trying to find a way for creators to run creative endeavors on web3 because they believe web3 is where we’re going, but may not be super comfortable with web3 yet. I feel like I’m really hunting down people who I know may be able to bridge this gap and show some excellent JB use cases.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-think-daos-are-still-new-enough-where-the-people-themselves-have-to-be-the-tools-almost-like-fleshy-uis-that-can-help-navigate-doers-who-may-not-be-fluent-or-even-conversational-in-the-web3-world-definitely-not-an-easy-person-to-find">I think DAOs are still new enough where the people themselves have to be the tools, almost like fleshy UIs that can help navigate doers who may not be fluent or even conversational in the web3 world. Definitely not an easy person to find.<a class="hash-link" href="#i-think-daos-are-still-new-enough-where-the-people-themselves-have-to-be-the-tools-almost-like-fleshy-uis-that-can-help-navigate-doers-who-may-not-be-fluent-or-even-conversational-in-the-web3-world-definitely-not-an-easy-person-to-find" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>No, haha, definitely not! We’re stuck in a beautiful moment where V2 is starting to open up an opportunity for non full-web3 nerds, whereas with V1 there really wasn’t much chance for non web3-nerds. V2 is starting to change that and I think that will lead to more great things.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-does-wagmi-fit-into-all-this">How does Wagmi fit into all this?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-does-wagmi-fit-into-all-this" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I think Wagmi has to take a position of palatable education. I think good branding does that. It points people in the right direction for the kind of info they want. I’ve always wanted Wagmi to be more educational, but when we started to do this with V1, V2 was on the horizon so we held off. After all with all the changes coming with V2 it didn’t make sense to produce a lot of content that would all just have to be redone a few months later. Now that V2 is here and coming into its own, we can really go full force into this endeavor.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="for-what-its-worth-when-i-started-as-a-total-jb-n00b-the-wagmi-videos-were-really-the-easiest-entryway-to-me">For what it’s worth, when I started, as a total JB n00b, the Wagmi videos were really the easiest entryway to me.<a class="hash-link" href="#for-what-its-worth-when-i-started-as-a-total-jb-n00b-the-wagmi-videos-were-really-the-easiest-entryway-to-me" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Yeah and that’s what it’s about. We want creatives, people who may be a bit unclear on web3, but who see where its going and recognize its value. And those people will bring their supporters over. Making great content to help ease that transition into web3 is a biggie to attract those people.</p><p>In terms of Wagmi’s future, I’d ultimately love to see Wagmi move away from full-time JB stuff and move more toward helping projects on the platform succeed. We could give these projects a little shove in the creative department, whether by helping them with animations, designing mascots, and who knows what else.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ive-felt-like-jb-high-could-be-a-central-point-of-info-for-newbies-obviously-a-lot-of-that-exists-already-elsewhere-on-the-web-but-do-you-see-any-value-in-really-doing-like-a-web3-crash-course-on-jb-high-to-truly-onboard-a-total-n00b-from-starting-to-finishing-their-first-project-creation">I’ve felt like JB High could be a central point of info for newbies. Obviously a lot of that exists already elsewhere on the web, but do you see any value in really doing like a “web3 crash course” on JB High to truly onboard a total n00b from starting to finishing their first project creation?<a class="hash-link" href="#ive-felt-like-jb-high-could-be-a-central-point-of-info-for-newbies-obviously-a-lot-of-that-exists-already-elsewhere-on-the-web-but-do-you-see-any-value-in-really-doing-like-a-web3-crash-course-on-jb-high-to-truly-onboard-a-total-n00b-from-starting-to-finishing-their-first-project-creation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I don’t think it’s overkill to do that at all, we just have to be clear on our time cost, and we shouldn’t invest too much time if there are more efficient ways to do it. I think a web3 crash course could be done in 2-3 animated shorts plus maybe a page or two on JB High; it’s not a heavy lift.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-it-changed-since-youve-been-there">How’d you get started with JB, and how has it changed since you’ve been there?<a class="hash-link" href="#howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-it-changed-since-youve-been-there" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>From the very beginning, I was trying to figure out from what JB could be. Jango’s take was that JB was a payment terminal, so I was like okay, are we building Stripe for web3? But then he was talking about treasuries, and discount rates and bonding curves, and pre-minting tokens and reserve rates, and I was like man, nobody’s gonna have any idea what this is. When I finally grokked it I was like “Ohhhh, this is what this could be!”</p><p>I saw some possible use cases, and was talking to some of the early guys about what it could do, but I think none of us really grasped it. It was so new and there just wasn’t really a concept you could build off, you really had to understand it for what it was, as something unique, and that took time.</p><p>But before even all that happened, I was working with Sage to figure out the brand and how we can we make this whole JB thing feel cool, and actually one of the first things we messed with was claymation.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-saw-a-claymation-video-floating-around-is-that-one-of-those-early-things">I saw a claymation video floating around! Is that one of those early things?<a class="hash-link" href="#i-saw-a-claymation-video-floating-around-is-that-one-of-those-early-things" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Yeah, that’s one of the first things Wagmi ever did! It was a lot of fun.</p><p>Another biggie early on, actually probably the first thing that came up as important, was starting to think was how could we help people understand what JB could do. So I figured “Oh, I could launch a project on JB and that could serve as an example for people of what to do.”</p><p>So I told Sage, hey, let’s run something like an animated studio/illustration studio out of JB, really as an example of JB’s power, and that was the birth of Wagmi. And it has been an absolutely great example. I’m really glad we did that rather than stay as paid contributors in JB itself. It serves as a great example for how projects can coexist in the space and serve one another.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="was-jb-your-first-jump-into-web3">Was JB your first jump into web3?<a class="hash-link" href="#was-jb-your-first-jump-into-web3" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Yeah, it was! I’ve just always been interested in tech projects and when I got to know jango and peri and they were talking about tech projects I just wanted to hang out and learn, and to try to help in any way I could.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="man-thats-such-a-high-bar-for-a-n00b-to-get-into">Man, that’s such a high bar for a n00b to get into.<a class="hash-link" href="#man-thats-such-a-high-bar-for-a-n00b-to-get-into" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Haha, yeah it was a high bar, I still remember it took me 4 months! I spent 4 months saying the words and having no idea what I was talking about— “Yeah yeah yeah, the payment terminal, and getting ETH out and bonding curve, and the redemption rate,” I had no idea what I was talking about, and then, finally one day it clicked! It was so rewarding, and it validated to me so much of what I had been trying to grasp.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-ran-into-that-in-a-very-dense-philosophy-text-once-that-was-like-that-so-hard-to-grasp-you-wanna-walk-away-since-you-definitely-dont-wanna-stick-around-and-feel-stupid-thats-a-tough-spot-to-be-in">I ran into that in a very dense philosophy text once that was like that. So hard to grasp, you wanna walk away, since you definitely don’t wanna stick around and feel stupid. That’s a tough spot to be in.<a class="hash-link" href="#i-ran-into-that-in-a-very-dense-philosophy-text-once-that-was-like-that-so-hard-to-grasp-you-wanna-walk-away-since-you-definitely-dont-wanna-stick-around-and-feel-stupid-thats-a-tough-spot-to-be-in" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Yeah! Sticking around and feeling stupid sucks. You want to help, you want to chip in, and halfway through a sentence you realize damn, I don’t know what I’m saying, but now I’ve started talking and I gotta finish this sentence, haha. It’s like the brain needs contextual points of knowledge to learn the next thing, and some things are so far away from these basic knowledge nodes that you can’t bridge the concept. Then you’re like “Oh, it’s like Uber for Mcdonalds?” and it clicks all of a sudden. But what if you don’t have that basic script where you have to really put two or three of those nodes together to bridge over to a new concept. Sometimes you have the right teacher and they know that’s the case, and they’ll build that out for you, but otherwise you’re kind of reinventing the wheel in your mind, and for sure that can be so frustrating.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="im-glad-it-clicked-for-you-and-for-me-whos-your-fav-contributor-and-why-is-it-stevie-g">I’m glad it clicked for you (and for me!). Who’s your fav contributor, and why is it Stevie G?<a class="hash-link" href="#im-glad-it-clicked-for-you-and-for-me-whos-your-fav-contributor-and-why-is-it-stevie-g" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Haha, I love this question. I would say the thing that attracts me to Stevie G is his uncanny ability to come off as hyper-authentic. There’s never a moment where I listen to him that I’m not like, “This dude is so real, he’s like, such a good human.” Regardless of whether or not you are a good human, or you think you are, many times I come off as an asshole—</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="oh-yeah-you-dont-need-to-tell-me-coming-off-like-an-asshole-unintentionally-is-a-lowkey-superpower-of-mine">Oh yeah, you don’t need to tell me, coming off like an asshole unintentionally is a lowkey superpower of mine…<a class="hash-link" href="#oh-yeah-you-dont-need-to-tell-me-coming-off-like-an-asshole-unintentionally-is-a-lowkey-superpower-of-mine" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Hahaha! But Stevie G, man, I never once get that impression from him. Stevie G is an authentic G.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="definitely-what-would-people-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you">Definitely. What would people be surprised to learn about you?<a class="hash-link" href="#definitely-what-would-people-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Hmm… Let’s see… I’m an avid mountain biker. I actually used to be an avid kite boarder, but I picked an occupation that’s in direct conflict with kite boarding season. There was a point where I thought I may go pro. Hmm… other than that, as a child I was forced to do Hooked on Phonics, it’s probably not funny for anybody under the age of 35 since it didn’t exist for anybody that young, but like, when I had to do it, it was a joke, it was literally a joke that people would say to diss each other.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-remember-that-it-was-a-schoolyard-way-to-call-people-dumb">I remember that… it was a schoolyard way to call people dumb.<a class="hash-link" href="#i-remember-that-it-was-a-schoolyard-way-to-call-people-dumb" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Right! And when they said to to me I was like, “Yeah, actually, I am dumb!”</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="haha-to-be-honest-thats-a-pretty-awesome-comeback-thank-you-for-taking-the-time-mieos">Haha, to be honest that’s a pretty awesome comeback!

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>“Juicebox in the words of” is a series that highlights JB community members in interview form. Learn about members’ roles at JB and what makes them tick.</em></p><p><em>Podcast extraordinaire and overall smooth talker nicholas took a bit out of his schedule to sit and, for a change, be the interviewee. Starting out as a JB contributor who went astray, the prodigal son is returning to the JB atmosphere with twice the gusto he had before. Don’t call it a second coming, just call it finishing what he started. Read on to learn a bit about this erstwhile contributor-turned-vagabond, his aspirations at JB upon his return, and what his plans are for the future.</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-it-changed-since-youve-been-here">How’d you get started with JB and how has it changed since you’ve been here?<a class="hash-link" href="#howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-it-changed-since-youve-been-here" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I found Juicebox originally in June/July of 2021, and I was one of the people who came in through the SharkDAO door. I was involved in SharkDAO and I got to meet some of the people there, and got to meet jango who was the lead protocol dev there. Eventually my interest turned primarily to JB. I’ve always been interested in these tools that allow for social integration and JB was right up that alley in terms of tooling that lets people coordinate to create whatever project they want. On top of that they have this X factor which is the spirit of a true DAO— it’s not about VC or cash grabs— and I think that’s really interesting given the last 20 years or so of centralized social development in web2.</p><p>I contributed at JB where I could, did a lot of governance, operations streamlining, starting tye notion library and working on organization. In early 2022 I decided to take a step back, focus a bit more on programming stuff, solidity, NFTs, etc. Over the course of a few months I realized I’m just too fascinated by JB, and especially with V2 coming out and seeing this amazing potential. JB feels like an open source project with a revenue model, which is attracting incredible people from all over the world.</p><p>So I decided to jump back into JB. I put proposal in for trial payout and I’m hoping I can jump back into the team.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="theres-a-lot-of-excitement-around-v2-what-specifically-has-you-interested-in-coming-back">There’s a lot of excitement around V2. What specifically has you interested in coming back?<a class="hash-link" href="#theres-a-lot-of-excitement-around-v2-what-specifically-has-you-interested-in-coming-back" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Two things are drawing me back— tankbottoms, who has been building/adapting stuff related to NFT creation and minting and turning those into tools that can be used more broadly. If it can be pulled off correctly, I think it’ll go way beyond just JB. It’s really revolutionary and applicable in so many different contexts. I feel like I can be useful there in design/code/helping out.</p><p>That’s obviously enabled partly by V2. The treasury management stuff being discussed right now— like creating projects that allow you to diversify the treasury into other tokens, and using JB as mechanism for doing that— is extremely cool. V2 is so open-ended, and part of the lift involved is getting that tooling across to people.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-think-thats-a-biggie-jb-has-so-many-tools-but-i-agree-that-it-may-be-overwhelming-for-a-newbie-coming-onto-the-scene-theres-also-a-kind-of-idea-like-if-you-spotted-a-restaurant-that-served-italian-japanese-greek-and-turkish-food-you-may-think-okay-they-cant-possibly-be-doing-all-that-correct-what-do-you-make-of-that">I think that’s a biggie. JB has so many tools, but I agree that it may be overwhelming for a newbie coming onto the scene. There’s also a kind of idea like, if you spotted a restaurant that served Italian, Japanese, Greek and Turkish food, you may think okay, they can’t possibly be doing all that correct. What do you make of that?<a class="hash-link" href="#i-think-thats-a-biggie-jb-has-so-many-tools-but-i-agree-that-it-may-be-overwhelming-for-a-newbie-coming-onto-the-scene-theres-also-a-kind-of-idea-like-if-you-spotted-a-restaurant-that-served-italian-japanese-greek-and-turkish-food-you-may-think-okay-they-cant-possibly-be-doing-all-that-correct-what-do-you-make-of-that" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Yeah, for sure. What’s great is that JB has really shown that it is aligned with memetic fundraisers in the past. I don’t know if you’d call it product market fit (PMF) yet, but it has the orientation toward PMF with these memetic raises, some of them more enduring than others. Hopefully it can be useful for enduring long term treasury management functions.</p><p>One thing I think about— there’s lot of NFT projects that set aside a portion of sales/royalties to  a treasury (which is sitting in a multisig somewhere). Maybe the collection lost momentum, who knows, but that funding is still hanging around somewhere. I have an assumption that there are dozens or more multisigs that belong to a DAO that have 50-250 ETH sitting in it without a lot of activity. If those things had been run on something like JB, maybe there could have been tools JB would have offered to make sure funds like that were put to use.</p><p>I definitely do agree regarding the interface/tooling offerings— it’ll be interesting to see what happens since JB is one interface right now, and that has value. But ultimately I think we’ll see more interface experimentation. In the past when the Mandarin speakers came in, I was supportive of the idea to create some kind of interface that’s more conducive to that new community group. As JB grows I think we may see things like that.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-do-you-think-pmf-looks-like-for-jb">What do you think PMF looks like for JB?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-do-you-think-pmf-looks-like-for-jb" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I’m most interested in enduring projects that use the protocl as their treasury. I think—and maybe my thinking has evolved on it— but last year as I got to understand JB in greater detail, I felt like there’s two functions for DAOs. One is a place to hold your assets— that’s JB— whether assets are ETH or NFTs or whatever— and the other a place where governance happens. I don’t know that we’ve figured out the most effective way to run governance, but JB governance works extremely well in my opinion. The way JB uses the treasury to handle contributor salary, other expenses, or the network effect when projects pay each other— for instance how JB relates to Wagmi, Canu, Peel, Lexicon Devils— collaborative DAOs end up holding a piece of each other and having a stake in each other’s future. That has potential to have a serious network effect.</p><p>Look at SharkDAO, they have a huge amount of JBX, in their case they don’t really vote on stuff and their JBX isn’t super valuable, but it would be nice to start to see that happen with partner DAOs.</p><p>I think the thing we’re missing is the NFT thing— that’s the key in my opinion to returning revenue over time. Canu, Wagmi, etc., are paid through JB, so they can show how great the network is because they have locked in revenue from the revenue fees JB takes from all projects on the protocol. I think if we could create non-JB originating revenues, that would be fascinating.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="not-to-mention-the-landscape-may-be-changing-a-bit-here-lets-talk-about-soulbound-tokens-sbts-which-may-be-on-the-horizon-the-idea-here-is-tokens-that-are-non-transferable-some-say-good-idea-others-say-its-just-a-way-to-make-resumes-in-web3-what-do-you-make-of-that">Not to mention the landscape may be changing a bit here. Let’s talk about “Soulbound” tokens (SBTs), which may be on the horizon. The idea here is tokens that are non-transferable. Some say good idea, others say it’s just a way to make resumes in web3. What do you make of that?<a class="hash-link" href="#not-to-mention-the-landscape-may-be-changing-a-bit-here-lets-talk-about-soulbound-tokens-sbts-which-may-be-on-the-horizon-the-idea-here-is-tokens-that-are-non-transferable-some-say-good-idea-others-say-its-just-a-way-to-make-resumes-in-web3-what-do-you-make-of-that" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The idea of non-transferable tokens… it’s interesting. I think no matter what in web3, if you’re an amazing code you will probably always get work. But that being said treating SBT’s like a resume can definitely happen too. I have to say I haven’t read the paper yet, so I’m just going off of what I heard floating around the web3 space.</p><p>Long term, there’s a decent argument against it, which is that in ten years I don’t think any of us will be using the same wallet. But overall, I think it’s trying to answer the problem of these membership DAOs. If you base your membership on holding a market-tradable token, the appreciation of the token will ultimately result in the dilution of the quality of the members of your community as people sell.</p><p>Also JokeDAO comes to mind, where if you participate in their competition by submitting a joke, you get voting tokens for the subsequent competition.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="one-time-use-tokens-in-other-words">One-time use tokens in other words.<a class="hash-link" href="#one-time-use-tokens-in-other-words" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Yes exactly. I think that’s even more interesting to be honest. The ecosystem rewards people for trying new things and experimenting.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-about-sbts-as-a-scarlet-letter-in-other-words-as-a-means-to-damage-someone">What about SBT’s as a scarlet letter, in other words as a means to damage someone?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-about-sbts-as-a-scarlet-letter-in-other-words-as-a-means-to-damage-someone" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>For sure that could happen, I think it will depend on the person minting and their reputation. One of the things about NFTs I wondered was people doing antisocial NFTs, like people tokenizing their virginity, or tokenizing school shooters.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="excellent-points-whos-your-favorite-contributor-and-why-is-it-tankbottoms">Excellent points. Who’s your favorite contributor, and why is it tankbottoms?<a class="hash-link" href="#excellent-points-whos-your-favorite-contributor-and-why-is-it-tankbottoms" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Haha. Tankbottoms is great. There are so many great contributors honestly. If I had to point to anyone in particular, the person I admire most or seek to learn the most from is jango. There are many talented contributors, but jango has the talent I most wish I had— which is real clarity. It doesn’t mean jango knows everything and everyone follows him. It means he has real clarity around orientation to questions. You could call it vision, but that maybe that’s reductive. It’s more like in discussions he’s able to refocus very fluently. And of course being able to travel up and down the stack is incredible. Tankbottoms also is an unbelievable contributor in terms of accumulated experience and raw skill, which is so great. I mean, he’s just turning out stuff that other teams talk about for a year, and tank turns it out like that.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-something-people-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you">What is something people would be surprised to learn about you?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-something-people-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Lately I’ve been doing kickboxing every week with my girlfriend and roommate. I’m also a total youtube fanatic and I rarely watch under 2x speed. My biggest interest for the past little while is in Magic the Gathering! A friend gave me the idea that we’re like the CPUs when we play MtG, and the game is the rules of machine, and… it’s like if javascript was run by a company and the only thing you could exercise and execute were functions that are sold 10 times a year. I’m really fascinated by it. I also love going on really long walks, like for hours and hours.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-does-the-future-have-in-store-for-nicholas">What does the future have in store for nicholas?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-does-the-future-have-in-store-for-nicholas" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I’m working on an NFT collection, actually, that I’m really pumped about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1. Bug updates by @jango]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-bug-updates-by-jango">1. Bug updates by @jango<a class="hash-link" href="#1-bug-updates-by-jango" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>@Jango: The same bug update that I presented about last week that we caught about a week ago. As of a few mins ago about 95% got resolved to just the final step of re-issuing the tokens for those who contributed to projects before we re-deployed things. </p><p>Everything is being tracked in the <a href="https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/blob/main/security/postmortem/5.24.2022.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">postmortem</a> that is the V2 contract repository. I’m very excited to tie that off and make progress on all other stuff coming up. Also project creation is back up.</p><p>filipv: I am gonna ask about litDAO specifically. Are they holding back token narration for all projects right now?</p><p>jango: We’re gonna run a script to help go through play by play of what we’re doing. We re-deployed basically all the contracts except for Juicebox projects(so they can keep their NFT i.e. the ownership to the projects) and a few auxiliary contracts that don’t have dependency. We re-deployed the token contract, funding cycle store, the terminals, etc. Once projects re-launch their funding cycles, everyone starts from Funding cycle #1 again. The front end made it very easy to use the same configurations as their previous funding cycle in the old contract had. Once they make that, they also have 0 token supply in the new token contract. But several projects have already received funds and started distributing tokens.</p><p>The original plan was to have project owners initiate a few transactions to airdrop tokens to their token holders, which is super doable but requires 3-4 transactions and it’s a bit complicated. In general, the scope of the problem is very small, given where we are in the protocol deployed a few weeks ago. So instead, I’m gonna send a few transactions that we scripted after this Town Hall that’s gonna deposit and basically re-created the activities for each project. Let’s say moonmars have received 10 payments each with its memo and it beneficiary of token. We’ll just send those out again. And from the deployer wallet as we run the script, we will pay in some ETH and set the original beneficiary of tokens as a beneficiary. So once all the activities are up again, then the token balance of each project should reflect their old token balance. I’ll open a proposal to refund the deployer.</p><p>@filipv: So are we repaying all the balance that all the V2 projects have received so far?</p><p>@jango: I think the total will be 11ETH if all projects are to relaunch funding cycles, which is a prerequisite, and then we’ll drop the funds in both as a bonus for everybody for the hiccup, and also thanks for the patience throughout this process. I think it’s better to solve this problem with money, than to cause poor UX, and I think it’s worthy given its scale. But this also taught us a lot about how to solve this problem given a larger scope. That loss is in lieu of communication headaches that cause us to make sure that the projects are clicking the right button and not getting themselves into other nuts. </p><p>@filipv: Are we doing reimbursement for gas fees associated with redeployment and project updates?</p><p>@jango: Yes. The big one is projects that have deployed ERC-20, which is the most expensive transaction. We have a list of projects that have that before, and we’ll drop in 0.2ETH in their treasury, which is part of the number I quoted before. After this call, I’ll run it and we’ll be super in the clear and make moves towards the stuff we were working on before.</p><p>@filipv: Last question, what’s going on with the ETH in the V2 projects right now on the old version of the contract? Can project creators just distribute it if they’d like to, or figure out what they’re gonna do with it?</p><p>@jango: For the most part those have been distributed. I went through to empty those out as the UI no longer interacts with them. You can always go to etherscan.io to pull them out. I think litDAO has a 100% overflow, so any funds in there can be redeemed by token holders. So if you did contribute to the DAO before, it’s now a fine time to go and redeem, or they can submit a reconfiguration on the old funding cycle to raise and pull funds out. It’s the bonus we’re going to give them if they want to go to the trouble to get those, which is for them to choose.</p><p>Once we found this bug, it was tempting for us to just keep our heads down, mitigate it and try to fix it. But communicating with projects and making sure everyone understands what’s going on is important, so it’s certainly cool to do stuff and prod. </p><p>It’s still pretty incredible that we found this bizarrely niche bug this early on. I’m pretty confident here going forward. It’s kind of weird to start and then already have a bug. I definitely understand if there’s a sense of hesitancy. I’ll have to work through that, give it time and put weight on it incrementally and regain trust in ourselves. I feel pretty good about it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-morgensterns-ice-cream-event-by-zom_bae-and-kenbot">2. Morgenstern’s Ice Cream event by @Zom_Bae and @Kenbot:<a class="hash-link" href="#2-morgensterns-ice-cream-event-by-zom_bae-and-kenbot" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>@Zom_Bae: If you haven’t been keeping up, Morgenstern’s Finest Ice Cream is hosting a JuiceboxDAO event for three days over NFT NYC. We, as a DAO, got to vote on 6 custom unique ice cream flavors, which is pretty cool. Check out <a href="https://juicebox.notion.site/ICE-CREAM-FLAVOR-SUBMISSIONS-c84ed139d9a64bf68099a210942b98db" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a>, and submit your crazy wacky creations by June 2. On that day we’ll get a list compiled and vote on Discord for the top 6, which are going to be tweaked and refined by Nicholas Morgenstern himself and then be served at our event over the 3 days.</p><p>Kenbot and I over the last week have been really digging into this and finding a way to make it more than just an ice cream social. And I think we’ve got a really unique opportunity here to bring some really cool projects into Juicebox and get them building in the protocol, and also really get the word out for Juicebox. </p><p>We’ve been talking for a long time that Juicebox hasn’t really done a whole lot of marketing other than our twitter, word of mouth, and the big one-off projects like ConstitutionDAO and AssangeDAO. We are still in early phases for that, but the ice cream social the way it’s building up is gonna be an event inside an event of NFT NYC. We’re going to have a schedule of things going on each day. We’d love to do some twitter space, AMA and podcast if we can.</p><p>Lexicon Devils are making a replica of this event in <a href="https://www.cryptovoxels.com/spaces/344a9048-9c09-462e-9d76-f292185922a9/play" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cryptovoxels.com</a> , which is pretty cool.</p><p>So any of you is gonna be in NY for this event and is willing and able and down to be a part of that, I really want you to be.</p><p>@kenbot: What we’re thinking about is we can have their windows as soon as we can get going. So we can have a week running up before the event to promote right in the space what we are gonna be doing there. The thought is who do we want to reach out to, who’s walking by that place, who’s in downtown NY at that time, and we want to capture and have them come back.</p><p>So that’s going to be ideas that we can have a theme of bringing creatives together, to open their Juicebox projects and fund their dream projects. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-stories-about-blockspilt-and-nft-berlin-by-zeugh">3. Stories about BlockSpilt and NFT Berlin by @Zeugh:<a class="hash-link" href="#3-stories-about-blockspilt-and-nft-berlin-by-zeugh" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>@Zeugh: Me and JohnnyD have been going around for the last week. We’ve started the idea of testing the gorilla marketing tactics, by going to some blockchain, Ethereum or NFT conferences. This time we went to BlockSplits in Croatia and NFT Berlin so far. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-blocksplits">1) BlockSplits<a class="hash-link" href="#1-blocksplits" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We got to BlockSplit on Tuesday last week. First thing we swa was a panel of legal side of things about new regulations in the EU and it felt like this was the wrong place to be. We came to this event for 2 main goals. The first one was to do some user research, try to listen to people that are creating projects, and try to understand how they currently manage their treasury. And the other idea was to onboard some of them. The event ended up evolving into something we understand as Web2.5. BlockSplit Croatia was more of using  blockchain technologies on traditional startups. </p><p>Interesting insights from BlockSplit were, there were some L2 builders from Boba network and they were interested in how we can bring Juicebox to their L2. I found it unusual that there will actually be people building L2 looking for people to go into their chains. I talked to them and onboarded them to our server. They want to come on and discuss how they could help a process like this to happen. </p><p>Also from BlockSplit, there was a very interesting group called Resolute that focuses on web3 marketing. They got very interested in how we’re doing things and how they can help with that. I am bringing them to our server this week for them to take a look at our strategy discussion and the marketing part.</p><p>Everyone got interested in how we are doing things actually, no one has ever seen a DAO actually run and work with a profitable and functional business model. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-nft-berlin">2) NFT Berlin<a class="hash-link" href="#2-nft-berlin" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>From BlockSplit we flew to Berlin, and NFT Berlin was the opposite of BlockSplit, where most people were not directly involved with a project, they were mostly collectors and fans of the whole NFT fever.</p><p>In there we got in depth looks at what NFT creation could use Juicebox for. JohnnyD was amazing in focusing in how we can create better models using Juicebox, some templates or preset configurations that could be useful for NFT creators, to give their buyers or investors more confidence in investing, to make sure that if a rug pull happens everyone has time to pull back. Those features made everyone’s eyes shine.</p><p>We got in touch with NFT Club Berlin. They are a big local group of NFT investors and collectors. We have follow-up calls this week to show them how to use the templates so that they can start referencing that in their community.</p><p>The experience as a whole was great beyond the event itself. We stayed for the hackathon, helped people on the hackathon deploy or understand something about our products. We got invited for the ETH Barcelona to be part of the hackathon there to help them get DAO hackathon. They are interested in having us as the main DAO on that, because we were one of those that does have an actual toolkit and a workshop and content to provide for a hackathon. </p><p>And we faced the problem of gas fee in NFT Berlin again and again, for the fact that we only run on Ethereum was definitely a barrier for some project creators that we talked to.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-discussion">3) Discussion<a class="hash-link" href="#3-discussion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>@filip: Do you feel like what you learned from those events changed your strategy? Do you still feel the same way about the strategy?</p><p>@Zeugh: I don’t know. I really don’t know, because the strategy has been going back and forth from different talks, so I’m not sure if I have a clear feeling before saying it has changed.</p><p>I definitely feel more confident on going projects to projects in an event, just talking about Juicebox, asking what people are doing and how they are doing. I learned better the right questions to ask to understand if we can provide value to them or not, and to learn why we can why we can’t.</p><p>I think the most beneficial part was the user research part beyond the few projects we onboarded. I think it was the biggest gain.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-quizz-time">4.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who knew the pot smoking banana was the least strange one among us?]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Who knew the pot smoking banana was the least strange one among us?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="800am">8:00am<a class="hash-link" href="#800am" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>It’s a normal day at Wagmi studios. Burtula has posted a new animation of a Banny (Peach Banny to be precise) getting kidnapped in her sleep. Mieos likes it, but suggests smoothing it out, so the kidnapping can seem more natural. Tankbottoms is asking about asset folders to be filled out, and Sage is coming off being stranded in Idaho with a transmission-less car and working feverishly through her phone.</p><p>It’s only 8:30am. The day is just beginning. Felix has spent the better part of two days sourcing custom-made condoms— tri-fold condoms, to be exact, so each Banny can have their own condom packaging, with a pop-out tri-fold to really bring the point home. A banny wrapped in the coital experience, Felixander would tell you, is the most salient testament to the human condition.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1200pm">12:00pm<a class="hash-link" href="#1200pm" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Burtula is taking Mieos’ words of advice to heart. After all, if a banny is going to get kidnapped, that should look natural. What will future customers think if such a traumatic experience seems rushed or premature? Premature— Felix is thinking of a joke, but he’s abstaining. She works tirelessly to craft the Peach banny with more finesse, and in the wait one wonders about banny backgrounds— are we even saving all of them?</p><p>5 creative people stuffed into a studio, and not a shred of organizational prowess between them. Do we have a Peach Banny background? Of course we do. But where is it? Oh yeah, it’s in one of the thirteen discord channels at Wagmi, and it was posted a month ago. It may as well be in the ether, but that doesn’t stop us all from scrolling up wildly to find it.</p><p>Meanwhile tankbottoms is white knuckling it on at least hour 36 of a god-knows-how-long working sprint. His work pace has Cocaine saying bro, slow down, you’re harshing my vibe here. We try to get in touch with him, but on hour 36 the quality of response you can expect is a bit frayed to put it mildly. Tankbottoms operates on a bonding curve of consciousness— if you get your request in early, he will deliver a fucking spectacular answer. But if you’re in that last 5 hour span, you’re gonna get caught holding the bag.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="500pm">5:00pm<a class="hash-link" href="#500pm" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Meanwhile we’re trying to get a presentation on some UI from Sage. The Figma files are fire, and between randomly being jailed and what one can only assume is the wisdom derived from several ayahuasca trips, Sage delivers. She elegantly goes though all the work she’s put into the latest UI iteration, and everyone is blown away and gives her praises, but she has to cut it short because a coyote chewing on some old cigarettes by a roadside is giving her the stink eye, and it may get nasty.</p><p>They ask Felix what he thinks about the UI, but all he can think about is how a single tri-fold condom costs $1.64, but if we get ten thousand that price goes down to $0.46 per unit. He wants to make a joke about units, but he abstains. He’s crafting an email asking how many banana-pictures they can print on a single tri-fold, and he’s doing the math and thinking that we can make condoms cool, one self-referential banana at a time.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>“Juicebox in the words of” is a series that highlights JB community members in interview form. Learn about members’ roles at JB and what makes them tick.</em></p><p><em>aeolian is a longtime JB member and a front-end wizard. He has worked tirelessly for the JB cause and seemingly writes lines of code in his sleep. Lately he has championed discussions around how we evaluate compensation in the DAO, and most recently has submitted a proposal (in-process as of this writing) to reduce payouts across all JB contributors. Read on to learn a bit more about this front-end developer turned fiscal activist.</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-it-changed-since-youve-been-here">How’d you get started with JB and how has it changed since you’ve been here?<a class="hash-link" href="#howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-it-changed-since-youve-been-here" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Before JB, and technically even now, I’ve been a software engineer in the traditional web2 space working for startups, etc. I’ve been loosely dabbling in crypto over the years, but I always wanted to dive into it in a bigger way. Generally when I want to dive into something, I really wanna get into the nuts/bolts and learn it from the ground up. I finally found myself with the time to do that, and me and a couple friends found this NFT project we liked, and even though we couldn’t really afford to buy the NFT separately, if we pull our funds together… and it was like a lightbulb moment. We thought hey, what about this whole DAO thing happening— what if we make a DAO that buys some NFTs. So I found JB and started poking around, and it was coincidentally the same time that ConstitutionDAO was happening. I was drawn in by the amazing branding of Banny (a banana smoking a joint was just amazing) and the next day I wake up, log into discord, and I see the treasury has grown to like 20 million overnight. Once I saw that and started really thinking about the potential of this thing I immediately dropped everything I was doing and started trying to contribute where I could, especially on the dev side and front-end side. Peri welcomed us with open arms and the rest is history as they say.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="awesome-so-much-talk-lately-about-v2-how-would-you-put-v2-in-perspective-for-someone-not-technically-aware-of-all-the-changes">Awesome. So much talk lately about V2! How would you put V2 in perspective for someone not technically aware of all the changes?<a class="hash-link" href="#awesome-so-much-talk-lately-about-v2-how-would-you-put-v2-in-perspective-for-someone-not-technically-aware-of-all-the-changes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>V2, hmm. When we talk about V2 we’re talking about the protocol itself. Jango, Drgorilla and a bunch of others have identified some tings about V1 which were restrictive, like that projects can only raise money in ETH and not in other currencies, that there’s less flexibility around how they can configure projects to meet their needs, and so on. The protocol guys said let’s start developing V2 and improve it from the ground up, and so the front-end’s job in that is basically to support those new additions. There’s exciting potential use cases, like funding your project through your own NFT launch, or like a project that comes along that says we want to award contributors with an NFT that they can sell on secondary market, and the proceeds of those NFTs will go straight into a JB treasury. Another biggie is supporting multi-currencies— projects accepting stablecoins instead of just ETH. Truthfully we don’t even know all the possibilities that it is hopefully going to open up, which is what makes it all the more exciting.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="im-reminded-of-the-story-of-that-city-planner-in-england-way-back-when-who-had-the-roads-built-twice-as-wide-as-necessary-people-thought-he-was-crazy-but-he-saw-a-future-with-population-explosion-do-you-view-v2-as-built-for-the-realities-of-tomorrow">I’m reminded of the story of that city planner in England way back when, who had the roads built twice as wide as necessary. People thought he was crazy, but he saw a future with population explosion. Do you view V2 as built for the realities of tomorrow?<a class="hash-link" href="#im-reminded-of-the-story-of-that-city-planner-in-england-way-back-when-who-had-the-roads-built-twice-as-wide-as-necessary-people-thought-he-was-crazy-but-he-saw-a-future-with-population-explosion-do-you-view-v2-as-built-for-the-realities-of-tomorrow" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Haha, I super admire anyone that can have that kind of forethought and conviction in their idea of the future. When you’re building a protocol as the ecosystem saw with V1, it enables a set of use cases which, in the case of V1, proved to be successful with big fundraisers that make big volume in a short amount of time. Look at the internet– such a non-restrictive, base-level protocol, and look at it now. The creators of the internet would have had no idea that it would become what it is now. Not unlike JB with this website of this smoking banana that enables millions of dollars of fundraising.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="theres-been-this-wonderful-discussion-about-compensation-lately-where-does-a-dao-strike-a-balance-between-compensating-members-and-staying-lean-for-a-down-the-line-bigger-payout">There’s been this wonderful discussion about compensation lately. Where does a DAO strike a balance between compensating members and staying lean for a down-the-line bigger payout?<a class="hash-link" href="#theres-been-this-wonderful-discussion-about-compensation-lately-where-does-a-dao-strike-a-balance-between-compensating-members-and-staying-lean-for-a-down-the-line-bigger-payout" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>It’s really hard. Like someone said in that thread on compensation— I don’t remember who— but comparing people based on a number is just not healthy, right? That’s what people don’t like about traditional corporate life, and that’s why people find themselves in web3 and crypto. They want to escape that world and operate in a space that lets them do what interests them the most. In terms of how to think about it from a first-principles perspective, which I’m trying to do, let’s start with startups. I don’t think the startup model is perfect by any means– it probably disproportionately rewards the founders more than early builders. So that’s not exactly a blueprint for us either.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="its-just-so-complicated-right-so-many-smart-people-and-no-one-has-been-able-to-find-that-holy-grail-answer">It’s just so complicated right? So many smart people and no one has been able to find that holy grail answer...<a class="hash-link" href="#its-just-so-complicated-right-so-many-smart-people-and-no-one-has-been-able-to-find-that-holy-grail-answer" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Right. And drawing from the corporate world and those structures probably is not the right way to go about it either. I’m not a crypto/web3 maximalist in that sense though, I do think people can learn things from those who have come before us, but we’re here to make our own rules and to do what makes sense for us and what leads to the most amazing ecosystem that we can possibly build. That’s what we’re all here to do. The fact that that thread exists and other threads like it exist is a real testament to this community because we’re driven and passionate about figuring this stuff out. That, in my opinion, is the sign of a really healthy community.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="no-egos-can-be-around-in-this-right-how-come-egos-dont-seem-to-clash-more-in-these-situations">No egos can be around in this right– how come egos don’t seem to clash more in these situations?<a class="hash-link" href="#no-egos-can-be-around-in-this-right-how-come-egos-dont-seem-to-clash-more-in-these-situations" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>There’s something about JB, or the way that the community presents itself, whether on socials or within the discord, that it leads to a certain type of person sticking around. People are sufficiently motivated at JB. When teams break apart and things don’t happen it’s because people gave up on figuring out how to make it work. Everyone here recognizes the opportunity we have in front of us, to build this amazing thing and a solid foundation for us to all go forward. It’s a recognition that if we can really sit down and work all this stuff out we’re really gonna be able to build amazing things.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="do-you-think-the-jb-runway-threatened-by-the-compensation-models-we-have-now-jb-never-had-any-vc-coming-in-so-how-do-you-reconcile-that">Do you think the JB runway threatened by the compensation models we have now? JB never had any VC coming in, so how do you reconcile that?<a class="hash-link" href="#do-you-think-the-jb-runway-threatened-by-the-compensation-models-we-have-now-jb-never-had-any-vc-coming-in-so-how-do-you-reconcile-that" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>That’s the key point– and I’ve been guilty of this in the past myself— JB is very unique and the dynamics of the ecosystem are crazy. We really do have to think about this stuff. We have to sit down and think about it from a first-principles perspective, rather than approaching it in the traditional way of doing these things.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-about-the-workflow-over-time-problem-ie-what-happens-when-your-job-drops-off-in-work-to-do-because-you-executed-the-task-but-youre-still-getting-this-big-recurring-payout">What about the workflow over time problem– ie, what happens when your job drops off in work to do because you executed the task, but you’re still getting this big recurring payout?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-about-the-workflow-over-time-problem-ie-what-happens-when-your-job-drops-off-in-work-to-do-because-you-executed-the-task-but-youre-still-getting-this-big-recurring-payout" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>That’s the biggie, you’ve hit the nail on the head. One model we’ve stewarded is that the front-end team has broken out into its own treasury in Peel, and that allows us to be more intentional with how we fund projects. It really allows two things: we can onboard quickly those who we think are really good, and we can also understand their skill set right away. We know what we’re looking for and the broader DAO doesn’t have to go in and make a decision on every single recurring payout proposal that comes through that affects the front-end. That’s one model that’s been working for us, but these things are all emerging, and that what makes me super excited to be here in JB and in web3.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="got-it-okay-lets-get-down-to-brass-tacks-whos-your-favorite-jb-member-and-why-is-it-jango">Got it. Okay, let’s get down to brass tacks. Who’s your favorite JB member, and why is it jango?<a class="hash-link" href="#got-it-okay-lets-get-down-to-brass-tacks-whos-your-favorite-jb-member-and-why-is-it-jango" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Jango said something a while ago that really nails home why he’s so amazing, and the culture he’s ushered in at JB. I’m just gonna quote it here:</p><p><em>“i like hangin with folks that can be fluid between bullshitting and manifesting, fluid between appreciating beauty and ugly, fluid between conversation and silence, fluid between humor and practicality, fluid between been in awe of everything and focusing on the next idea in front of us. I'm attracted as fuck to people with big imaginations who make moves towards them.”</em></p><p>That was like such an amazing statement because it’s really hard to find people who are <em>your</em> people. I feel like my people are this: people who strike that balance between brilliance and focus, but also are able to laugh at the ridiculousness of life, and so I guess when I read that I was like damn, I will definitely be vibing here for many years.</p><p>But my homies at Peel definitely need a huge shoutout. This is the dream team and I'm super lucky to be a part of it.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-something-that-people-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you">What’s something that people would be surprised to learn about you?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-something-that-people-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Hmm… I don’t really know. I guess one thing is that I started programming very late, and I actually always wanted to be a film composer— writing music for movies. That’s what I was doing before becoming a software engineer. Through high school I was pretty much all about music; I played piano and a bunch of other instruments and I got really into writing music for film, and I thought I would take that road. Eventually I kind of just realized it wasn’t coming from a place of pure passion and excitement. I realized as a musician you have to write music you don’t care to write oftentimes, and take jobs that don’t interest you at all.&nbsp;So I looked for another avenue and it was kind of just random how it happened: I went to university for some unrelated degree and fell in love with programming and comp sci along the way.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In case you don’t know, Juicebox is the best way to fund and operate any Web3 business, especially NFT projects. If you’d like to know why we’d recommend reading <a href="/blog/why-juicebox-for-nfts">‘WHY Juicebox for NFT projects’</a> if you haven’t already done so first. </p><p>For now, we’ll be going deeper into Juicebox lore and fleshing out all the weird and wonderful options, looking at how to leverage them ideally for an NFT project. By the end of it, you’ll have set up a system where: </p><ol><li>Buyers of your NFT will automatically receive a quantifiable stake in your project’s treasury in the form of ERC20 tokens.</li><li>People can invest in your project without having to own an NFT. </li><li>Automate payments to your key team members and display them transparently to your community. </li></ol><p>In this article you’ll learn:</p><ul><li>How to create and configure a Juicebox project suited for an NFT collection</li><li>How to link royalty fees from your NFT sales to your shared Juicebox treasury</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-create-your-project">1. Create your project<a class="hash-link" href="#1-create-your-project" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image1-f5f507cc2807cb51ace766f0271396aa.png" width="1999" height="1144" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><em><a href="https://juicebox.money/#/create" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://juicebox.money/#/create</a> or <a href="https://rinkeby.juicebox.money/#/create" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://rinkeby.juicebox.money/#/create</a> (testnet)</em></p><p>I’ll go from the Funding cycle section of our create flow and recommend some possible starting points for your NFT project.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-funding">1. Funding<a class="hash-link" href="#1-funding" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="funding-cycles">Funding cycles<a class="hash-link" href="#funding-cycles" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>We highly recommend using a funding cycle. This is the time period over which distributions will be made and other Juicebox settings such as the discount rate will be applied. Common funding cycle lengths are 1 week, 2 weeks or 1 month.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="distributions">Distributions<a class="hash-link" href="#distributions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>You can specify the amount you’d like to distribute to each member of your team per funding cycle from the treasury. If you don’t raise the total amount of funds you’ve planned for your whole team, then each team member will be paid the percentage you’ve specified for them from any funds you have raised. For instance, if you planned for Mike and Bob to get 1 ETH each per week, but you only raised 1 ETH total in a certain week, then they will just get 0.5 ETH each. </p><p>If you’re opting not to go for the shared treasury approach, you can route all funds from the treasury straight to the owner, or a percentage cut to any other wallet address.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="token">Token<a class="hash-link" href="#token" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reserved-rate">Reserved rate<a class="hash-link" href="#reserved-rate" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>As mentioned earlier, whenever new tokens are minted as a result of someone buying an NFT or contributing for tokens straight up, this percentage of those new tokens will be reserved and the rest will go to the buyer. By default, these tokens are reserved for the project owner, but you can also allocate portions to other wallet addresses. A reserved rate of 50% will ensure the project owners maintain a majority share of the treasury and may be a good option for your project. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="discount-rate">Discount rate<a class="hash-link" href="#discount-rate" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>The discount rate incentivises people to get in early on your project. It controls how the issue rate of your community ERC20 token changes over time. A higher discount rate means people who buy your NFT in the early days will receive more tokens / ETH than those who come in later. An exact figure is hard to give, but with a funding cycle length of 2 weeks, a discount rate of 10% may be a good place to start.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="redemption-rate">Redemption rate<a class="hash-link" href="#redemption-rate" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>This redemption rate encourages token holders to hodl and stick with your project token for the long term. On a lower redemption rate, redeeming a token increases the value of each remaining token, creating an incentive to hold tokens longer than other holders. Similar to the discount rate, you’ll have to gauge how aggressively you want to pull this level, but a redemption rate between 50 and 75% is probably a good place to start. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-rules">3. Rules<a class="hash-link" href="#3-rules" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="pause-payments">Pause payments<a class="hash-link" href="#pause-payments" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>You probably don’t want to check this. Check it only if you want to hold off payments for a certain period after you create your project.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="allow-token-minting">Allow token minting<a class="hash-link" href="#allow-token-minting" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>You probably don’t want to check this either, it allows project owners to mint any amount of tokens to anyone on demand. Whenever you have this enabled, your project will have a warning flag on its Juicebox page warning contributors of the possibility of their tokens being diluted. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reconfiguration">Reconfiguration<a class="hash-link" href="#reconfiguration" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>This is important. It restricts how long before the next funding cycle reconfigurations must be submitted before they are able to take effect. For example, with a 3-day delay (a good starting point), a reconfiguration to an upcoming funding cycle must be submitted at least 3 days before it starts. It’s a great way to ensure your community against any malicious owner behavior. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-create-a-payable-address">2. Create a payable address<a class="hash-link" href="#2-create-a-payable-address" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>This will create an Ethereum address that can be used to pay your project, rather than having to go through the Juicebox interface. It will be necessary in the model of the Juicebox NFT project we’re going for, since you will use this address as the destination for your royalty fees. You will be prompted to do this when you create your project, but can do it later at any time in the ‘Tools’ section of your project page pictured below. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image2-5d26b330ea8f22c7d9c6ab98e456de54.png" width="1999" height="616" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-do-your-thang-on-opensea-or-wherever-send-royalty-fees-to-the-payable-address-let-the-magic-happen">3. Do your thang on Opensea, or wherever. Send royalty fees to the payable address. Let the magic happen<a class="hash-link" href="#3-do-your-thang-on-opensea-or-wherever-send-royalty-fees-to-the-payable-address-let-the-magic-happen" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>And that’s it! Congratulations. You’ve set up a system where buyers of your NFT will have a quantifiable stake in your project with community tokens (ERC20), and have allowed people to invest in your project without having to own an NFT. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>We hope you’ve enjoyed digging into the details of Juicebox and how you can leverage the protocol for your NFT project.

Basics of Juicebox<a class="hash-link" href="#1-basics-of-juicebox" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Juicebox allows people and communities to crowdfund their project and give their contributors a stake as community tokens (ERC20) in return. Once funds have been raised, the protocol can be leveraged to automate payments from the treasury in a controlled, transparent and decentralized fashion. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-why-juicebox-nft-projects-are-better">2. Why Juicebox NFT projects are better<a class="hash-link" href="#2-why-juicebox-nft-projects-are-better" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Juicebox NFT projects are a win-win for both communities and owners. There are countless ways you can configure your Juicebox project for your specific goals, but here’s a general strategy we recommend for NFT projects: </p><p>Instead of sending your NFT royalty fees directly to the owner’s wallet, you can send them to a shared treasury owned by your community. Upon buying an NFT (and paying the royalty fee), the new owners of your NFT’s would automatically receive an amount of your community tokens proportional to their purchase amount. The more someone pays for an NFT, the more tokens they receive. This gives your community members a formal and quantifiable stake in the shared treasury - your project as a whole. Your community could also contribute and gain stake in your project by just buying tokens, not necessarily having to own an NFT. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="for-communities">For communities<a class="hash-link" href="#for-communities" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="token-value">Token value<a class="hash-link" href="#token-value" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>You can use these tokens for anything you want, perhaps governance, raffles or exclusive access to future drops. But a unique feature of Juicebox is that it allows the option for these tokens to be redeemed by community members for a portion of your project’s treasury. As the pie grows over time, a contributor’s tokens will be worth more. Your community can gain on top of just the increase in value of their NFT’s.</p><p>Having a shared treasury is optional, however, and you could instead just have all royalty fees sent to the Juicebox project route straight to the creators. In this case, the token your community receives could not be redeemed for any ETH. </p><p><strong>Your community can gain on top of just the increase in value of their NFT’s.</strong></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="trust-and-transparency">Trust and transparency<a class="hash-link" href="#trust-and-transparency" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Firstly, a properly configured Juicebox project makes rug-pulls impossible. You can give your community time to react before any changes to your funding and spending parameters take effect. </p><p>Additionally, your Juicebox page shows exactly how all your funds are flowing - how much and where it’s coming from, and where those funds are subsequently being spent. The only way funds can leave the treasury is by configuring and scheduling a payment, for which your community will always have time to react to. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image1-26d67a61b9ceb1555aa19b1714143f81.png" width="1999" height="1013" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><em>Spending (left) and income (right) shown on a project’s Juicebox page</em></p><p>You may be asking, <em>“Ok I see the benefit for my community, but what’s in it for the owner?"</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="for-owners">For owners<a class="hash-link" href="#for-owners" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="maintain-a-high-stake-in-your-project-using-the-reserved-rate">Maintain a high stake in your project using the Reserved Rate.<a class="hash-link" href="#maintain-a-high-stake-in-your-project-using-the-reserved-rate" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>If you choose the option of your token holders being able to redeem from a shared treasury, we should mention that as an owner you can control exactly how much stake you maintain of this treasury over time. The reserved rate allows you to keep a portion of all newly minted tokens. A 50% reserved rate means you will maintain a 50% ownership of treasury no matter how big your project gets. </p><p>This is mostly irrelevant if you don’t want a shared treasury and to simply route all funds into the project straight to creators. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="allow-for-people-to-contribute-to-your-project-without-buying-an-nft-and-therefore-raise-more-funds">Allow for people to contribute to your project without buying an NFT and, therefore, raise more funds.<a class="hash-link" href="#allow-for-people-to-contribute-to-your-project-without-buying-an-nft-and-therefore-raise-more-funds" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>This model opens up a massive and mostly untapped market of people interested in investing in an NFT project without necessarily buying an NFT. Whether it be too high of a floor price, not wanting to go through the whole selection/auction/listing process, or anything else, Juicebox opens the door of your project to these people through community tokens.</p><p>Consider if the projects like the Bored Apes had followed this model - how much more funds could the creators have raised as a result of people buying some stake worth less than the purchase price of a Bored Ape? </p><p>How much more funds could the <!-- -->[Bored Apes]<!-- --> creators have raised as a result of people buying some stake worth less than the purchase price of a Bored Ape? </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="automate-payments-to-key-members-of-your-team">Automate payments to key members of your team.<a class="hash-link" href="#automate-payments-to-key-members-of-your-team" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>If you’re going for the shared treasury approach, Juicebox allows you to pre-program specific distribution amounts from your treasury to any ETH address, e.g. pay vitalik.eth US$1000 every week. This saves the hassle of manually transferring funds to your team from your personal or shared multisig wallet. </p><p>Otherwise, as mentioned prior, you can simply route all funds from the project to creators and their teams. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-what-does-it-cost">3. What does it cost?<a class="hash-link" href="#3-what-does-it-cost" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Up front, all Juicebox costs is gas. As of the 23th of May, it’s about US$150-200 worth of gas to launch your project, deploy your own ERC20 token and a payable ETH address for you to link your royalty fees to. Then, for any funds you end up withdrawing from your project’s treasury, you’ll pay a 2.5% fee to Juicebox. But, for this 2.5% cut of your payout distributions, you’ll receive Juicebox’s native token (JBX) in return at its current issue rate. Moreover, your fee will give you a growing stake of Juicebox’s expanding ecosystem and treasury. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>If this has already been enough information for one reading, feel free to tap out now.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-a-bug-saga-by-jango">1. A bug saga by @jango<a class="hash-link" href="#1-a-bug-saga-by-jango" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Jango: This morning STVG posted at the loose_thoughts channel: What if we could pause a project mid-Funding cycle? He was trying to play with the Marine County Swim Association project(this is a sweet event pulled off by STVG) to pause it since the event was finished. And through a series of botched configurations, the project ended up in a really weird state. The project’s current funding cycle is set to start on May 28th which makes no sense as the current funding cycle should always be active. </p><p>So at this point, something is for sure up or at least not served correctly or the front end isn’t interpreting correctly. That’s quick to check. The etherscan.io confirmed that the current funding cycle starts at a later day. I went to check the unit tests and there were a bunch of cases that I felt this was trying to cover and still passing. So I tried to create the situation exactly and was still struggling to do so. What ended up being the exact step to follow to recreate the bug which I eventually found was: if you create a funding cycle or configure a funding cycle with a duration and then let it roll over to the next funding cycle without reconfiguring, now you’re in the 2nd funding cycle, now you’re in the 2nd funding cycle of the 1st configuration. Then you configure the subsequent one, and before the current cycle is over, you reconfigure the subsequent one again to override the previous configuration. If you’re in this exact state, the 2nd reconfiguration, instead of being based on the 1st FC which you kinda rolling over onto, will be based on the funding cycle you are going to override. </p><p>That puts us in a weird state. The edge case was not covered in the tests. So I quickly wrote a test and confirmed it, before I found the one line to add to the contract to fix the problem to make the test pass, which I’ll post here:
<img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/code-e4c28620c5d5d721371c3e85652c998b.png" width="958" height="274" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>So once we identified the problem, sorry I'm kind of doing a realtime postmortem here and I’ll write this up later, then we can start to think about the solutions and consequences. Luckily V2 was deployed only recently and there are only 27 projects at the time. And most projects don’t have large volumes in their treasury either, the bug doesn’t affect the treasuries so funds are all safe, too. </p><p>All we are gonna do is letting these projects know that this condition exists, and from our point of view, we should probably make the adjustment in the funding cycle store which is a dependency like all other contracts or the core contracts in the ecosystem which is gonna nudge us towards republishing and redeploying the V2 contacts. </p><p>It’s not 100% sure that we need to redeploy the project contract, which will be nice with all the NFT stays. Even if we do, we can get in touch with all these projects, make sure they can redeploy on the new version, make sure funds get moved over and make sure token holders get airdropped the new supply of the token.</p><p>This comes in the name of diverse conversion stuff we have been talking about. We know we are working with fragile and delicate infrastructure. I am happy to catch this very early on in the process, as this V2 stuff just gets trickier over time. And then obviously if you  were to know about it and think about it maliciously, it’s an exploit if you want to use it in that way.</p><p>A big shout out to folks involved to kinda come through and help once we wrapped our heads around the issue. Peri came in right away and adjusted some of the front end to make sure new projects can not be created on juicebox.money. And shout out to STVG for clicking a button which you described as chaotic and you weren’t really sure if you miss-clicked a few things, or you did a couple of things twice because you forgot to do it. That ended up showing us the way.</p><p>It’s pretty mind-blowing that that was a test case we have yet to cover. And it’s hard to believe there are any more of these lingering. The scope of these contracts is pretty tight. I think V2 actually removed bits and pieces of funding cycles, so the V2 funding cycle store is way leaner than the V1 one. I haven’t checked if the contracts of V1 have the same vulnerability in it, but I actually don’t think they do because that piece of logic got reassessed. </p><p>@filipv: Huge shout out to everybody esp. STVG. This is so good that this was found now instead of 3 months from now.</p><p>@0xSTVG: I’ll ask my original question. Is there a way to pause? I’m in a 5-day funding cycle, I reached my goal so I wanted to just pause payment even though I am in the middle of the funding cycle. I can’t do that, I can pause it but it’s going to take effect only when the current funding cycle is over.
@jango: yeah, you can set up a pay delegate to revert the transaction if you’ve met a goal, you could write an extension that just does that if you want. But by default you can’t. Once we put it on the shelf then you’ll be able to pull it off the shelf and use it, but we have to build it out first.</p><p>It feels like it’s at a lighter moment now. Most of the morning was pretty tense on my end at least, and obviously we take these things very seriously, make sure we’re articulating this stuff correctly and documenting that correctly. I think we are still all gonna make it.</p><p>All V2 projects on the site currently have a sweet alert on them. Hopefully all the communities running on it, not just project owners we reached out, see this warning and get a heads up for what’s going on. Thank you Peri, for coming through.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/project-79494c1581f0f74e00746563a6f98954.png" width="952" height="496" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-demo-of-vebanny-by-0xba5ed">2. Demo of veBanny by @0xBA5ED:<a class="hash-link" href="#2-demo-of-vebanny-by-0xba5ed" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I’ll give a quick refresher on what veBanny is for, as I don’t know if everyone here has heard about or seen it before. So, veBanny is a way to make sure everyone who’s voting in the governance is focused on the long term instead of the short term. It’s a way to lock your tokens, the longer duration you lock for, the more voting power you’ll get. When you do that, you’ll get veBanny NFT to represent your locked tokens. </p><p>(Screen sharing of demo starts)</p><p>In the future you don’t have to receive the ERC-20 to lock your position. And it allows the public to extend the lock.</p><p>@filipv: Can you explain very quickly what a public extension is?</p><p>@jango: By default, once you’ve created a lock, then it’ll linearly decrease when time ticks on. Let’s say you lock it for 100 days, tomorrow the lock will be 99 days. So to get the full voting power, which is a function of how many days between now and the end of the lock, you’ll want to extend the lock back to 100 days, which is a transaction that needs gas. But sometimes if you have someone to be able to go in and send that transaction to extend your lock, you can set that flag to True. </p><p>If you intend to keep a locked position, maybe you have a voting habit, or someone who can easily afford that transaction can go in and extend it for you. Or if you don’t choose that, we’ll have control over it so you can inch toward liquidity of your position at the rate that you choose. That thing was added as a result of discussion when this was being designed, that a lot of people want to keep their voting power full, but they might not want to be sending transactions regularly and this is precautionary. I don’t know at what frequency people will want to send that extension transaction on their own, but it was a quick flag to add that didn’t open up a lot of weird complexity, so we put it there.</p><p>@filipv: Is that something that can be reconfigured? Can I send a transaction to turn off the public extension on a position that I already have?</p><p>@jango: The owner can change that whenever.</p><p>@0xBA5ED: So here it is, I own it(finished locking position). So I’m going to take a pretty big risk right now because I haven’t tested this on the testnet yet. Because the minimum duration is a week to lock, so I made one veBanny a week ago. Just one, so I haven’t tested it yet. We’re going to redeem it, we’re going to unlock our tokens and redeem them for ETH from the overflow in one transaction. So let’s see.</p><p>@jango: This is another cool feature of the ve mechanism that is different from the traditional Curve ve mechanism on which this is based. Since Juicebox has redeem functionality, you can redeem your treasury tokens for the underlying treasury asset. At any point you can still redeem your locked position for the underlying treasury assets, independent of whether it's locked or not. So you can have your tokens locked for a year, you’ll be able to get your JBX back until the year’s up. But you can burn your NFT to get your JBX to get the underlying treasury asset whenever.</p><p>@0xBA5ED: Exactly. So before I burn it, I thought that we just show the voting power actually decreasing. So this is my current voting power and every block that passes it’ll decrease. So this decreases linearly until all my NFTs expire, then I won’t have any voting power left.</p><p>@filipv: So is voting a function of block number, or a function of time and it’s just updating on block numbers?</p><p>@0xBA5ED: It’s a function of time operating on block numbers.  (redeeming…) So here it’s gone already. As you can see I burned the NFT which also burned the JBX that was locked and I got the ETH from  the overflow. I’m very happy that it works, actually I haven’t tested it yet. I know it was going to work, but still it’s a bit scary to do a demo live for the 1st time.</p><p>@Felixander: A quick question in what jango was talking about, but let’s say somebody buys an NFT and they lock 100 days, and on day 75 they want to get out and they burn everything. So you can burn the NFT and the JBX. If they went in let’s say for 100 dollars, then on day 75 if they burn everything they are not gonna get 100 dollars back right? Is that gonna depend on the value of JBX or how does that work?</p><p>@jango: They’ll be able to, all the underlying JBX are gonna be redeemed with the exact same function that the treasury normally redeems at. That doesn’t decrease linearly. The idea is probably the value of the JBX or the NFT, it’s literally the floor, so you might find more value in NFY by selling it on the market.</p><p>But the point of doing this is because they were functionalities actually fairly meaningful in the Juicebox ecosystem since we’re minting JBX open-endedly. So someone can come in right now and put in like 6m dollars worth of ETH and they basically get 50% of the JBX supply or whatever. If they weren’t trying to coordinate with the rest of us, they could take everyone’s assets then basically use that big pool of JBX to control whatever was there before. The point of redeeming is that if somebody does that in a way that’s not trying to integrate with the current system, then anyone who currently has JBX is basically getting a shit ton of money from this person who comes in, so anyone who doesn’t want to be a part of that ecosystem can redeem basically and leave with a big chunk of what was just poured in. So this is in a way to disincentivize this takeover thing. So we need to keep that mechanism in place regardless of if JBX is locked because if we lock it and don’t keep that mechanism in place, that vulnerability becomes larger. </p><p>@Felixander: One more question for the NFT profile page. Are we making a difference between different Bannies, obviously they have different histories and stats, or are we putting that in the NFT profile page or is it gonna be the same page and the info exists somewhere else on a website or something?</p><p>@tankbottoms: The thinking was just keep the metadata inside the veBanny strictly about Juicebox with the exception of the name of the character, the model and the description will be added as well as these characteristics, shadowness etc. Everything in the metadata for the token will be related to Juicebox and will speak about Juicebox. There’s a location where we could put a URL in the description in the external URL so that in the opensea UI when you go to a detail page you can jump to it. The thinking was to keep it specified to Juicebox. With that said, there’s something you can do when you load up a web page with CSS and Javascript. I am trying to do some animation with the token, so when you go to a detail page, we could put a hidden link in that people can click to jump to Bannyverse.</p><p>@Felixander: So the metadata will be the same except for the name? Or will the description model also be different?</p><p>@tankbottoms: All tokens will be unique to the lock duration. There’s 300 tokens of each range, e.g. 0-99, 100-199, up until 100m and there are five locked positions for each token. Those 300 will have metadata that says who the character is, what the duration lock is, their motto and their history. The name of the token will be the name of the character.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-vebanny-front-end-by-jmill">3. veBanny Front End by @Jmill:<a class="hash-link" href="#3-vebanny-front-end-by-jmill" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p> (demo undergoing……)</p><p>We have a deployment of this to Rinkeby now. I’m working on a contract reader actually populating those with real user data and then working on the transactions after that. The goal right now is to spend the next few days working on the contract reader transactions populating with real data and just moving the component around to where they need to go in the application and getting the front end of this at the door. </p><p>@mieos: I think this looks pretty great in this little side panel. I was skeptical about it, if we’re thinking how projects could launch a toggle over to set a locked voting token option and this sort of pops up in the UI of their project. Maybe it’s a lot of info and there’ll need to be a lot of education that goes with their community, but it’s great that it can all happen right here. For what it’s worth, I think it looks pretty good. Maybe it’s because I understand it, but it looks nice to see it in action.</p><p>@Jmill: I do agree with that because the flow for almost everything project management related is that it never takes you to a new screen entirely. Any other configuration you’re doing is out of the drawer or model, so you know that we can keep that paradigm for this also. I think it’s good that the actual controls of it are quite simple. If the user has 10 positions, there’s a good way to show that here without making them scroll forever.</p><p>@jango: We’re also getting rid of the delegates onchain in this contract, which might allow us to really get rid of it from the UI as well and we’re managing the delegates via other means like Snapshot and potentially to other stuff.</p><p>@mieos: I guess I missed that bit. I think that’s great, certainly simplifies the experience of a person who doesn't need to learn what it means to delegate or take part in that same moment.</p><p>@jango: At this point, I think there’s still some research work for filipv on the best means. The Snapshot delegation strategy seems compelling, and there’s other schemas we’re thinking about. I think the goal of all this stuff long term is to get rid of the multisig. To get rid of the multisig we have to do some kind of on chain voting, and on chain voting can be expensive, so we have this delegation. I think there’s some creative ways we’ve been bubbling up in several veBanny related threads that seem really promising. The delegate stuff was a blocker for this to the voting weight stuff. I’m pretty confident that we can get rid of it from the design scope for the front end for the time being, we’ll work it back in later.</p><p>@Jmill: Just from a user’s standpoint, it’s a really touchy issue of how you open up this delegate picker and how do you decide what to show, which delegate option to show to the user. There wasn’t a really great answer there as far as implementing that in the rest of the UI. I’m just working from the mocks but it’s pretty easy to remove the delegate stuff.</p><p>@filipv: ENS sorted alphabetically and free delegate. One thing I should add about Snapshot delegation. There’re hybrid solutions you can do using safe snap to have on chain execution, but you still need off chain queuing, so I’m not confident in Snapshot delegation as a strategy long term on chain governance. It’s good for hybridized stuff and getting close to there, but ultimately there does need to be some form of delegation if we want to be fully on chain. But I imagine there’s other layers we can think about. </p><p>@jango: Yeah, the disposable token strategy (see <a href="https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/961007548553637970/974046109615931432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>) is very compelling to me. For now this project has a lot of merit and we still can lean on the same points of vulnerabilities that currently we are at. We’re having a multisig, having an on chain voting which seem fine tradeoffs for the time being as we work towards to study our future.</p><p>If we can eventually have these as soon as people start having these Banny characters representing their position in governance then we’re going to see these characters everywhere because it’s kind of like an identity in the community. So as you start voting on Snapshot, we can also roll out interfaces and take inspiration for the work that folks at NounsDAO are doing to kind of participate with your Banny and lean in to the stuff WAGMI is doing to extend that even further.</p><p>@mieos: I just love the idea of getting the Bannyverse and these veBanny off the ground, but I can’t wait till the next DAO actually just uses the same implementation of voting and either uses WAGMI or somebody else to create these stake tokens. I’m excited about this rolling out to other Juicebox projects and creating value from.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-product-roadmap-by-aeolian">4. Product Roadmap by @aeolian:<a class="hash-link" href="#4-product-roadmap-by-aeolian" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>@jango: The veBanny stuff is great but we can’t ship it yet because we don’t have V2 tokens up yet. And all the stuff that’s up depends on the V2 JBX being out. So we’re in a transition period of V1-V2. We’ve got to transition the V1 JBX to V2 JBX, and we’re currently talking about a few designs to do it. Coming off product roadmap discussion we’ve been having in the strategy channel, we are gonna focus on making sure folks have an easy way to pay their V1 JBX to the treasury and get their V2 tokens in return, and making it easy for other projects like SharkDAO for instance, to do the same. That way we can get a lot of V1 projects who are still using their treasuries in earnest onto V2 and then build these new features on there their folks can use. So I think that’s the area of focus for the time being and there's a couple of ways to go about it. Aeolian do you want to hit up the current thought process?</p><p>@Aeolian: Totally. Quickly from Peel’s perspective and the front end perspective, as jango has said, the immediate focus is getting this V1-V2 migration flow done, designed and implemented. There’s a few different ways to go about it and jango said some good ideas in the strategy channel which everyone can check out. That’s our immediate priority. So Peel is going to return to development life cycle which is going to basically in line with Juicebox funding cycle, we're currently on FC#22, and the work we get loosely scheduled, everyone can check out here on our Github project.</p><p>There are 3 main things we’ve been working on:
V1-V2 migration flow,
coming up with solution for handles for V2 projects which includes cool crossover with ENS names,
some iterations on payout splits UX that making that a little more intuitive which is pretty exciting as well.</p><p>We will be focused on these for the next 2 weeks to one month, ironing out little bugs that have come up in V2 and refining experience alongside these big features.</p><p>And beyond that, we had really good discussions in the strategy channel. Definitely encourage everyone to come hang out there and drop ideas.</p><p>I think the overarching alignment is to figure out how to get more activities on the network and more long term oriented activities. I still think there’s a few obvious things that we can build initially that have surfaced, and one of those is the multi token payment terminal stuff. </p><p>“Roadmap is coming together in a loose way”.</p><p>@jango: Everything is great. It’s occurring to me that finding the transition between projects is fairly meaningful to right patterns or timeing or whatnot. It’s sometimes not just a matter of feature itself but where it fits compared to other things.</p><p>So all these little motivations can all play into the roadmap in an interesting way that certainly takes the high level metrics we care about into account. So it’s absolutely a luxury to have 4 or 5 really delicious projects on the finish line right now. But figuring out a way to actually take them through the finish line in a way that makes cohesive sense is gonna be a lot of fun and can take a lot of patience from a lot of folks who have been working on each of these projects. But I think many of them don’t really have and might find themselve wanting something if we don’t do another piece beforehand. If we try to do them all at the same time, it’s probably gonna be like everything somewhat half baked. We’ll revisit this discussion probably for 15-20mins in every Town Hall to give updates on where we are at.</p><p>I think this line of thinking at least makes cohesive sense from our current standpoint, but can always change over time.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5-nft-framework-by-tankbottomseth">5. NFT Framework by @tankbottoms.eth:<a class="hash-link" href="#5-nft-framework-by-tankbottomseth" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>(demo undergoing……)</p><p>I’m thinking maybe anybody can make the NFT and associate it with a project. But in the recent discussions, originally any NFT that came out of this system is tied to a project, but there’s a bunch of feedback with a basic point that lets people do just whatever they want to do. I’m really looking forward to Aeolian's splits. The idea is making an NFT as a project owner or as a project contributor for a project to sell on the market place of Juicebox. There are everyone’s ideas to roll into advanced mode or simple mode. There can be instructions on image NFT, music/video NFT, and p5.js. </p><p>As you can see, it’s just a lot of stuff. If you want to learn what to do, you can go to the create mode, and basically go through a PFP, or p5js or music, then create your collection to redefine your asset, review and deploy it and then price it and attach it to a project.</p><p>@mieos: Where would a Juicebox project contributor who wants to send some money to a project go? Where would they go to purchase this NFT? How would that look?</p><p>@tankbottoms: For things that need to be minted, this area where you can contribute could be a tab where you can mint an NFT. There’s also the idea that makes a kind of landing page for a mint, then there’s also the idea to have a Juicebox marketplace like Jango did. There’s definitely more experimentation where it’s gonna leave. The core ideas are making this tool pretty fancy and giving projects the continuous reasons to get ETH going into the treasury. They don’t have to worry about the whole split thing at some point after they do their NFT thing, like how much you want to go to the treasury or go to your wallet. I think that would be super useful.</p><p>@mieos: I think the NFT capacity inside juicebox is gonna add a lot of functionalities for projects and sort of just simplify this heady shit for staking projects. And it’s just a lot and I think it just helps democratize getting contributors in the door and checking the boxes that make sure their project is strong and has all the utility. </p><p>@tankbottoms: I hope so. I mean I don’t wanna work on stuff after this ever again, just put in everything I know how that you can milk out of an NFT and the tool to simplify it. I think in advanced mode or simple mode, everything will have a lot of feedback in terms of how it actually gets implemented.</p><p>@mieos: I’m curious, Nicholas, do you have thoughts about this? You’ve seen a lot of projects roll out with NFT. Does this strike any chords inside you?</p><p>@jango: This is definitely a big thesis on how the community can derive more cash flow. But it’s kind of a self-contained project for the time being, for sure it will make its way to product, once a lot of these granular things get knocked out in the next several months. I think this project could certainly have life on its own, maybe on its own site for experimentation to start. I feel very confident about the product per se and it’ll be unfolded in due time. </p><p>@nicholas: That was really what I wanted to say. It’s so powerful and has so many tools in what you build. You’ve created all-in-the-best class creation tools in one tool. I know you’ve got ideas about on chain also, so it’s even like tools that barely exist and are separated from multiple products. If you are a generative artist, there’s a couple of things out there that you can use. There’s a few artblock clones, then there’s a manifold that has something, there are private companies that can work with you, is it good enough to be in direct competition with those things like a choice on people’s mind? Or is it like I want to do a Juicebox project and I want to fund it with NFT? I think the truth is probably it can do all of those things. I think probably just have it on its own site, as it’s going to be difficult to integrate elegantly. I want to think more about what interfaces make sense for it.</p><p>@filipv: I wonder, looking at this demo and the demo by Jmill earlier, if it makes sense to start implementing some form of project page customization for project creators where project creators say if they want to put NFT market interface on their project page can switch on something in the metadata and then can configure what they want to show on their pages?</p><p>@jango: If you look at the screenshots shared(below), I am very interested in the same idea. And I wonder if it’s gonna be self-contained in the idea of a payment terminal, so maybe instead of imaging the whole site as what you can bring your payment terminal which is basically a functionality to move funds into the treasury according to some means. The customization is at least scoped to that box, this is a mock that we’re still playing with ideas here.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/terminal-1f040785fced8f2393f1086812ce33d7.png" width="954" height="752" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>@filipv: I think this is so exciting for existing projects, I know so many projects, like SharkDAO, have spoken about doing NFT issuance on Juicebox. This is pretty crazy. I don’t think anything like this exists in general and something like this could really draw people into the Juicebox ecosystem. Like Nichola said, this is a combination of all of the best. And the fact that this is in Juicebox potentially is super super crazy.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="6-dune-dashboard-of-juicebox-logbook-share-by-twodam">6.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>“Juicebox in the words of” is a series that highlights JB community members in interview form. Learn about members’ roles at JB and what makes them tick.</em></p><p><em>0xSTVG is a JB die-hard, having been around since the early days. As the DAOs onboarder and bona fide swag and sticker monger, you can see him around the discord always helpful and ready to answer questions. Recently we had a moment to chat and I was able to hear his wonderful JB origin story, and his priorities in the JB space. Check it out below!</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-jb-changed-since-youve-been-here">How’d you get started with JB and how has JB changed since you’ve been here?<a class="hash-link" href="#howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-jb-changed-since-youve-been-here" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I was in there early! I learned about DAOs through Rare Pizzas and this guy named snax— who I gotta give a shoutout to ‘cause he’s the one who introduced me to DAOs— was buying free pizzas on pizza day. It was me and him and 2 other peeps on Clubhouse, and I was like this is stupid, no way this is gonna happen. As I got more comfortable in the DAO space, I eventually found my way to SharkDAO. I had started seeing these SharkDAO logos and I figured hey, I have a printing shop, I should make some hoodies with logos on them to give away, and I did (and they were expensive!). Jango and nicholas were people who helped guide me through sending out those hoodies, and so I got to know them and got to know JB. I decided to start making some JB clothing with graphics as well, and eventually I got put together with Zeugh and the talk was about community. I started helping wherever help was needed, like with governance, moving proposals along as they were coming in, etc. Eventually filipv jumped in and we started tag-teaming it and doing the podcast, which ran for a while.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="filipv-is-great-is-it-fair-to-call-you-two-the-gruesome-twosome">Filipv is great. Is it fair to call you two the gruesome twosome?<a class="hash-link" href="#filipv-is-great-is-it-fair-to-call-you-two-the-gruesome-twosome" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We worked very closely together and he ended up taking on some huge responsibilities, but we still lean on each other a lot when it comes to opinions and direction. I would definitely say I’ve learned a ton from him and I think he would say the same. Every once in a while we’ll pick up the phone and call each other and just say “Hey, how you doin’?”.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-see-you-as-this-onboarding-wizard-where-did-that-start">I see you as this onboarding wizard, where did that start?<a class="hash-link" href="#i-see-you-as-this-onboarding-wizard-where-did-that-start" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>It’s definitely a roll I’ve grown comfortable doing. I remember doing onboarding with MoonDAO and Slice, and eventually then for JB. It’s also interesting that that sort of merged into this weird testing and feedback roll too. I found myself in the front-end chat more and more (I don’t know if I’m providing value there– I hope I am!) to try to test various things, launch projects on test net, find obscure bugs that are here and there and provide suggestions/feedback based on what the onboarding calls are giving me, so it’s kind of become a merged roll. Being in that close proximity to the user gives a lot of great insight and perspective.</p><p>I also think there needs to be a shield between the regular user and developers. I’m very adamant that there needs to be some distance there. I’ve always appreciated jango saying we’re all builders at JB, but let’s be honest, they’re (the devs) are the builders– the developers on the JB protocol side and the Peel Team, they’re really building and everyone else is providing support. Since I joined JB I’ve always felt the need to kind of protect the jangos of JB because they’re so hyper focused that distractions can lead to mistakes, and that can be a big problem. I think a lot of organizations should take on that approach, to be honest, to make sure those core builders are shielded from the basic questions that other contributors can answer. I feel like that’s where I slid right in, I can answer those questions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="im-reminded-of-high-level-athletes-and-how-theyre-trained-the-trainer-almost-has-to-take-a-caretaker-role-ensuring-that-distractionsobstacles-are-cleared-so-that-the-athlete-can-do-what-they-do-perform">I’m reminded of high level athletes and how they’re trained. The trainer almost has to take a caretaker role, ensuring that distractions/obstacles are cleared so that the athlete can do what they do: perform.<a class="hash-link" href="#im-reminded-of-high-level-athletes-and-how-theyre-trained-the-trainer-almost-has-to-take-a-caretaker-role-ensuring-that-distractionsobstacles-are-cleared-so-that-the-athlete-can-do-what-they-do-perform" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Exactly. It’s all about minimizing distraction. It’s interesting that you bring up athletics; I was a former athlete and after that have been involved in high level training— olympics, NCAA athletes— and the one thing I’ve carried on in my life moving into JB and other things is to eliminate distractions and be in the moment. If you are distracted about the outcome of something, you’re taking away energy from the task that you’re actually doing, and in athletics that could be the difference between a win and a loss, a championship and coming in second. It sounds super corny but launching new extensions has become that for me– that’s the championship, we gotta get there, how do we get there, how do we stay focused are the questions I have bouncing around in my head. I’ve always been an idea person— someone who can really thrive in environments where we’re talking about ideas— and I’ve always been good at that I felt, and JB is this crazy environment where people take ideas and build off of it into something else. It’s like a dream come true.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="there-almost-seems-to-be-a-hippy-spirit-at-jb-people-are-just-so-open-im-thinking-of-the-compensation-discussion-from-a-few-weeks-ago-just-an-open-discussion-no-one-at-each-others-throats">There almost seems to be a hippy spirit at JB– people are just so open. I’m thinking of the compensation discussion from a few weeks ago. Just an open discussion, no one at each other’s throats.<a class="hash-link" href="#there-almost-seems-to-be-a-hippy-spirit-at-jb-people-are-just-so-open-im-thinking-of-the-compensation-discussion-from-a-few-weeks-ago-just-an-open-discussion-no-one-at-each-others-throats" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Yeah, especially with a topic that’s been so sensitive our whole lives– we don’t talk about salary IRL, and to have this open dialogue is special. More so to have the validation that what you’re providing is worth the payout that you’re receiving– there’s no better feeling than that. Having the support of the community has been an amazing feeling for me. People don’t realize how important that is to me– to my personal being. It’s quite an experience and one that I don’t take for granted.</p><p>Regarding compensation, if you don’t pay the people who are irreplaceable, they’re gonna go somewhere else. I think that’s an important point. There’s also people within the DAO that are just completely connected to the DAO itself, like if jango leaves, or Drgorilla leaves, what is JB, or Peel, or what even happens to JB?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fair-question">Fair question.<a class="hash-link" href="#fair-question" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I’ll tell ya right now– if jango decides to do another project, I would ask him if I can go with him. You just can’t replace certain people. So if you don’t pay them, they’re gonna be gone. All that said, I do think we need to be aware that we don’t have unlimited resourced. At the same time I think there’s enough people in the DAO that aren’t necessarily leaning on JB for all their bills/everything they do. So if there’s an emergency situation where people have to back off/reduce payout, I think we’ll see that happen.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-the-lack-of-assholes-and-mentally-checked-out-people-at-juicebox">Why the lack of assholes and mentally checked-out people at Juicebox?<a class="hash-link" href="#why-the-lack-of-assholes-and-mentally-checked-out-people-at-juicebox" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I think because everyone at JB right now has proven their value, and people who haven’t don’t stay around for very long; they weed themselves out. I think there’s also a level of respect from each person that everybody kind of has each other’s back. If you come in and try to take advantage of the DAO, I think the community can read that like a book because we all had to pay our dues. Everyone who’s being paid recurring payouts has been told no at least once– that’s a common denominator we all have. I think when everyone’s gone through that there’s a level of respect and community, which you see in how we treat each other in our day-to-day.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="for-sure-okay-switching-gears-who-is-your-favorite-contributor-and-why-is-it-zeugh">For sure! Okay switching gears: who is your favorite contributor, and why is it Zeugh?<a class="hash-link" href="#for-sure-okay-switching-gears-who-is-your-favorite-contributor-and-why-is-it-zeugh" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Haha, I think Zeugh is great– he’s awesome!</p><p>You know, I don’t know who my favorite contributor is. I’ve worked closest with jango and filipv probably, but I’ve gotten to know the peel team a bit more and I’ve really enjoyed them asking me for feedback/allowing me to provide feedback. Right now I couldn’t answer who, I just love working with jango and filip– they definitely help me out and give me a strong feeling of purpose.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-something-somebody-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you">What’s something somebody would be surprised to learn about you?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-something-somebody-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I think the biggest surprise would be… I have four kids! That is something that actually helps me with what I’m doing at JB– I’m good with time management/organization, and can make time for everything. My oldest son is really active with sports, so I’m juggling a lot, but even on the sidelines I’m always on the discord.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, May 17th, JBers got together for a fun and productive Town Hall session. Read on to learn a bit about what was discussed!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="product-perspective-discussion-kicks-off">Product Perspective Discussion Kicks Off<a class="hash-link" href="#product-perspective-discussion-kicks-off" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>On the heels of debuting V2, the DAO has pivoted to look forward toward future trajectories. The question of “What’s next?” was an ongoing discussion to kick off the town hall, and the overarching question of how JB will orient itself was bounced back and forth between members. One current effort is around finding and fixing all the bugs one would expect when you roll out something as wide in scope and breadth as V2, which is an ongoing endeavor the devs are focusing on, particularly as they work to build out extensions that were previously not possible with V1.</p><p>Safe to say where JB finds itself today is quite incredible, and has etched out a presence and community known for providing an excellent tool that works and is powerfully scalable. The use cases solved for already have proven successful and powerful, and the discussion of what other future use-cases exist is ongoing. Head over to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/973802723420028958" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#strategy</a> channel to learn more.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="delegating-jbx-now-possible">Delegating JBX Now Possible<a class="hash-link" href="#delegating-jbx-now-possible" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We now have delegation on snapshot, so you can delegate your JBX to other addresses for snapshot voting. A major thank-you to DrGorilla for making this possible and putting so much effort into the cause! </p><p>The way it works is, for example, if you have 1 million JBX, you can delegate it to someone with 3 million JBX, and that person will have 4 million JBX voting power. But if you do choose to vote later, their vote will decrease by that same 1 million, and your vote will be as strong as your own JBX (1 million). This is a flexible way that people can share voting power without sacrificing JBX or transferring it directly to one another. To learn more check out <a href="https://vote.juicebox.money/#/delegate/jbdao.eth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="twodam-joins-and-rocks-with-data-displays">Twodam Joins and Rocks With Data Displays<a class="hash-link" href="#twodam-joins-and-rocks-with-data-displays" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The absolutely awesome twodam was able to come join us today at our town hall, and gave an awesome presentation on his new dashboard for JB. It’s a powerful new dashboard with some absolutely awesome data displays, check it out <a href="https://dune.com/twodam/Juicebox-Gas-and-Fun-Facts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="taking-canu-to-new-heights">Taking Canu to New Heights<a class="hash-link" href="#taking-canu-to-new-heights" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Zeugh spoke about the role of CanuDAO to help other DAOs with marketing and community needs, and underscored the need to grow CanuDAO on par with the growth JB has seen over the past several months. The goal is for CanuDAO to provide high quality marketing and community-building services to JB, and also to affiliated and new DAOs that enter the JB space over the coming weeks.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="snapshot-of-jb-in-a-bear-market">Snapshot of JB in a Bear Market<a class="hash-link" href="#snapshot-of-jb-in-a-bear-market" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>While the bear market has dropped the value of ETH, with continued careful treasury management the DAO has a healthy runway. There are core functions that JBers will continue to take part in and carry out, and proposals for these core areas will continue forge on. Furthermore, an excellent opportunity is within the recognition that during any downturn of the market, yield and liquidity tends to dry up in places where it was accessible before. The can serve as as silver lining for JBers. Also, a proposal to review the DAO foundation is on the books, so all members please take a look at that proposal and discuss it ahead of its snapshot vote next week.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ice-cream-and-banana-costumes-in-nyc">Ice Cream And Banana Costumes in NYC!<a class="hash-link" href="#ice-cream-and-banana-costumes-in-nyc" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>JB is considering a partnership with Morgenstern’s Ice Cream parlor in NYC. The goal is that JB would deck out the ice cream shop for four days with Banny art and posters and custom ice-cream flavors and creations. JBers who network in NY ahead of the major cypto conference can point people toward the ice cream shop, meet them there to conference, and spread the good word about Juicebox. Contributor filipv will be greeting new and old members in a full-sized banana costume, and tank_bottoms is permanently banned from the event. Come enjoy the scene, more info the come!</p><p>(For a full recording of the town hall, including the legally binding declaration filipv made to wear a banana costume for the entire 4 days, click <a href="https://www.notion.so/FC-21-Town-Hall-B-7d34d29859a64fc18b4feadd70074f94" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.)</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1.Product prioritization discussion @jango:]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1product-prioritization-discussion-jango">1.Product prioritization discussion @jango:<a class="hash-link" href="#1product-prioritization-discussion-jango" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><strong>@jango:</strong> </p><p>We are to some extent acknowledging the moment we find ourselves in from a product perspective, specifically juicebox.money essentially. We just got to the V2 milestone which is massive and there is natural inclination to add to what’s next. We have a bunch of projects in flight, as we discussed in last Town Hall.</p><p>There’s a lot of work going on and a lot of them are closing the finish line. They are probably not going to be in production at the same time, so we’ve got to figure out what our priority is and the way we think about prioritization going forward. Maybe we could just say we’ll do it next week once we get it more put-together, although it is solid as it is.</p><p><strong>@aeolian:</strong> </p><p>I think we can refine it a little bit. By next week, we probably will have a more solid plan before we actually gonna build. Yeah, we can leave it until next week.</p><p><strong>@jango:</strong> </p><p>I think the main thing is that there’s a lot of fun, powerful, shiny things in a lot of people’s work, which is about to have the possibility to come into fruition. For the time being, it’s quite clear what the priority is, that’s risk mitigation and making sure these small bugs that naturally have found themselves in a little bit to the product via this long stretch. There’s a couple of blaringly obvious pieces that the V2 has. </p><p>So in the short term, maybe a week or a few weeks, it’s really coming to terms with what those are and making those as clear as possible in the UI and then giving us an avenue to peel those back as we have known extensions, because almost all of the stuff is extension related. We can create the system to disclose one at a time appropriately. And it’s not a big shiny future but it’s pretty important. I think top priority with these things is to keep things from going to zero, kind of our job. </p><p>The 2nd priority is currently straight in the dark to increase the number of projects and the volume of payments. The good news is there is plenty of work we can do right now to stitch up the risk stuff and the bug stuff as we deliberate strategy. But as that gets wrapped up, then we’ll want to all be on the same page about what we're trying to deliver next together.</p><p><strong>@aeolian:</strong> </p><p>I think it’s worth calling attention to the fact that it’s quite amazing Juicebox gets where it is. We should all have confidence at least from the UI perspective. When projects come along that kinda have the fire power, it’s able to really facilitate the payments. So it’s like, do we take this to the next level? What’s the next level? That’s really the point of the strategy channel and that document(<a href="https://www.notion.so/juicebox/juicebox-money-direction-b9bdac96c0f446a492ee76dee4faa4cf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>)and these discussions.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2brief-explanation-about-jbx-delegation-by-filipv">2.Brief explanation about JBX delegation by @filipv:<a class="hash-link" href="#2brief-explanation-about-jbx-delegation-by-filipv" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>We now have delegation on snapshot, so if you go to <a href="https://vote.juicebox.money/#/delegate/jbdao.eth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a>, you can delegate your JBX to other addresses for the snapshot voting. Tks for the amazing help from @drgorilla btw. Let’s say you have 1m JBX and you’re delegating to someone with 3m JBX, when they vote, they're gonna have 4m JBX. But then if you vote after they voted, their vote will go down to their original 3m JBX, which means you still can vote on any proposal you want and they will lose your delegation, specifically on that vote. Right now this is working with both claimed and unclaimed JBX and then we’ll be moving over to the veBanny when it happens.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3work-report-by-twodam-on-new-dashboards-and-protocol-research">3.Work report by @twodam on new dashboards and protocol research:<a class="hash-link" href="#3work-report-by-twodam-on-new-dashboards-and-protocol-research" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>There is a new Dune dashboard made by twodam in <a href="https://dune.com/twodam/Juicebox-Gas-and-Fun-Facts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a>, in which you can find gas fee specification about setting up and managing a project in the protocol, as well as some fun facts such as “projects created per address”, or “ how many has an ENS” and so on.

Sometimes I try to find signals in these numbers. So I appreciate the readiness to take on new requests and make dashboards for things over time. It’s damn helpful.</p><p><strong>@twodam:</strong> I have made some dashboards and maybe I need to write some reports based on these data.</p><p><strong>@jango:</strong> I don’t know if VJ or Goldstein have worked using these dashboards but they created reports that might be based on your number, which I am actually almost certain they are. Like coming together and understanding how to distill these facts into narrative and we can use several people taking the steps like that. So yes please, I think VJ and Goldstein will keep doing that.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4community-and-market-cohesion-by-zeugh">4.Community and market cohesion by @Zeugh:<a class="hash-link" href="#4community-and-market-cohesion-by-zeugh" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p> It’s more of informing and getting opinions here. Since last time we decided collectively how we would be improving our community through the way we manage the server and things like documentation and onboarding, we have grown a lot. It has been a good while and now we have more than 3,000 new members and lots of new contributors. For those that maybe don’t know, CanuDAO, the DAO that I am paid through, is a working community here in Juicebox. </p><p>Lately I noticed and more people also have the feeling that in our whole marketing community, the way we communicated as a whole has not been as efficient as it could be because we don’t actually have coordination between ourselves. Last week, I talked to Felixander and Casstoshi to invite them into CanuDAO too. We have this model of having a separate DAO, like WAGMI and Canu, to make decisions and work things around to actually develop it as a service to Juicebox. But as it’s growing , it’s getting hard to get the cohesion, so I’m trying to get more people working on the community side here in Juicebox to get inside Canu too, so that we can have more specific time to talk about the Juicebox community together. </p><p>So this is to inform all of you that Felixander and Casstoshi have come in, in a way that we can communicate better like in SEO(Search Engine Optimization), pulp writing, community management. It’s also an invitation for anyone that is dedicating their time in Juicebox to work community part to also join Canu, to come to our meetings where we can have more time to discuss perspectives, to discuss what we’ve been seeing and ideas we’ve been having in Juicebox so that we can go back and deliver better community management. I feel as the community grows and  the roles for keeping the community healthy get bigger, but Canu didn’t get bigger at the same speed.  The tasks and everything expanded and Canu kept at the same size.</p><p>We’re about to renew our payout proposal in the next cycle, so this would be a good moment for people doing community stuff and wanting to get paid through Canu. It’s more of an invitation and explanation of the reason for this invitation.</p><p><strong>@filipv:</strong> For someone like Matthew and Briley who have recurring payout and work directly for Juicebox, what advantages are there to work for Canu? Or are you talking more about coordination？</p><p><strong>@Zeugh:</strong> Not necessarily I am moving payouts to Canu, for some it makes sense, for others it doesn’t. It’s okay to join Canu no matter if you get paid through it or not. I think it’s gonna be important now that the V2 is out, and efforts in my perspective are to onboard new people and new projects, to help people coordinate and cohesion can be of great value here.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5macro-environment-and-morgansterns-ice-cream-shop-event-by-jango">5.Macro environment and MorganStern’s Ice Cream shop event by @jango:<a class="hash-link" href="#5macro-environment-and-morgansterns-ice-cream-shop-event-by-jango" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="macro">Macro:<a class="hash-link" href="#macro" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>As we’re all aware, the treasury has decreased in dollar value quite a bit with Ethereum events in the market. It doesn’t affect our day to day activity, just in a sense affects our horizon. I think what we can expect going forward, obviously we can’t control what happens on a big picture scale, but running a fundraising platform does encourage us to continue to bring insights to each other over time from the perspective of how capital is being managed in macro. Looking at the runway we have, it’s a good opportunity to reflect on our mission and really focus on it. I think we’re at a comfortable place and we can certainly keep on for a while longer even if the access to capital affects us, which will affect all the projects on the platform and subsequently our revenue stream. Even if things were to slow down in a couple of years, we will still be comfortable in the runway's perspective if we manage the treasury appropriately. These are the things to keep in mind when we’re thinking about prioritizing the initiative that we’re trying to further.</p><p>There are a lot of things that are very fundamental and core to our commission statement that I think we’ll have no problem continuing to further for the next long while. During any downturn of the market, it’s yield and liquidity that tend to dry up while they were pretty accessible before, so we have an opportunity to recognize that we are a funding platform, there’re a lot of people now that are maybe venturing somewhat into the unknown, into new opportunities and having to retreat into their fundamental convictions of what they want to do in the projects they think are important in the moment. I think really understanding the powerful projects that we can fund are not only going to be sustainable through whatever macro environment we find ourselves in, but also maybe these kinds of projects are gonna define the future market cycles or future building cycles. </p><p>I’ve put up a proposal to revisit the DAO Foundation document, reading through it and what we verified in the past still feels honest and great. It’ll be nice to go in the upcoming governance cycle. I want to make sure we’re committing ourselves and that we’re willing to spend sources on that.  We feel very serious about these things and that mission statement feels very sincere. We are indeed willing to work through whatever resources we have available to accomplish these things but realizing that things could be worse and there’s sacrifice that have to be made. But we also have to be in tune with the fact that this isn’t a project that reads similarly to other web2 related startups. </p><p>I think a lot of ways in which we use the treasury funds can be used to help projects start up and build during this time. I think these can be among the more powerful projects to emerge. Whether we do it collectively through DAO funds or we do that through individuals who are getting payout from the DAO in recognition of their work, is still up in the air. It’s way easier to support individuals as we have been doing it in the unit of ETH sent out per unit of dollar denominated payout, which is greater now for theoretically each of us are getting payout have more ETH overtime. It’s totally up to you what you’ll do with that, but it’s an opportunity to recognize here our job isn’t necessarily cut. It is just to recognize what our roles here are, looking for one building and we’re the ones helping (recording lost for a while)</p><p><strong>@mieos:</strong> Do you think it’s worth revisiting the redemption rate? If capital preservation is the thing the DAO is interested in, maybe retching that up just to touch might be useful and disincentivizing. We’ve probably gone through a bulk of the redemption, and I think it might be worth revisiting it but curious what other people think.</p><p><strong>@jango:</strong> That’s the obvious one. Thanks for bringing that up. That’s an easy one to do on the surface to help protect funds, though it kinda lowers the floor price which is held up great. That mechanism is one of the standouts of the current JBX implementations and we can definitely use it here.</p><p><strong>@mieos:</strong> I think it’s also worth mentioning just as a bit of anti-fud that the general theme during bear market cycles that if we’re going to see one like the rest of crypto history has laid out, which I am skeptical of, is a great time to build and thankfully we’re building a piece of software as a tool for people who are trying to build. </p><p><strong>@jango:</strong> I wouldn’t be surprised. I think it’s probable that the next while the market is continuing its current trend, we’ll see a lot less campaigns to purchase things at very high valuations, like a 50m constitution. But we’ll also see a lot of projects that are building long-term concepts, and I think that has been our thesis for a while now that the spotlight has been on the high raisers which make the project that’s earning 5ETH or 10ETH seem insignificant. But I think it’s those projects building things that last in business model that are going to shine through, and I don’t think there’s going to be thousands of ETH for these projects either. I wrote somewhere in the chat today, I think it makes a lot of sense that I bring it up here again. I encourage each of us to find 1, 2, 3, 4 projects around over time, led by people you particularly believe in or come to believe in, and add yourself in that project, and really figure out what they need to be successful. They probably come out from one perspective and maybe lack the resources, information or technology to do other parts of the project. We don’t need to do all in the same project, and I’m sure we’ll see each other around in all kinds of Discords helping things come into fruition. I think being hands-on and patient is going to pay off.</p><p><strong>@filipv:</strong> I think,  if anything, this could galvanize us further into building out both tooling, storytelling and communication in such a way that really emphasizes Juicebox’s capability for long term treasury management for treasuries that evolve. </p><p><strong>@mieos:</strong> I think it’s probably the best time in history for the best part of crypto to grow and become valuable, and the worst part of crypto to kinda slowly back into the shadows a little bit. That was a really loud bull market with a lot of madness, which certainly is not the reason why I’m here. I’m excited to build out some of the promises that the Ethereum has to offer.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="morgansterns-ice-cream-shop-event-during-nft-nyc">Morganstern’s Ice Cream shop event during NFT NYC:<a class="hash-link" href="#morgansterns-ice-cream-shop-event-during-nft-nyc" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><strong>@kenbot-studiodao:</strong> Morganstern’s Ice cream is in downtown on the low east side. It’s always featured in all kinds of TV series, like Billions, and a totally iconic destination in downtown NY. He makes all kinds of flavors of ice creams, and he wants to make some custom flavors for the promotion so there would be some Juicebox oriented banana flavor that we can have some conversation with. At the same time last year, it was something like a prototype that if you have a token, you can get access to secret sandwiches not on the menu. This year, he’s going to do a burger pop-up with an incredible burger chef who’s nationally famous. So this would be like tagging along and building something for Juicebox where we can onboard people in real time in a special session of the shop he would hold for us.</p><p><strong>@jango:</strong> </p><p>NFT NYC is a Monday - Thursday event, so we’ll block off a chunk of time from around noon till 6pm, which is the prime time for people in NYC to stop by and have ice creams and burgers. We could basically deck out the place in Banny, like you got Banny plastered in different places, you got ice cream flavors that Juicebox and Banny related. We can invite and meet up with folks whoever is in town.
Folks can stop by, and like Kenny said they have some criteria like onchain criteria of contributing to JuiceboxDAO or having JBX or being part of the project or whatever we decide, if we ship the veBanny in time, it should be veBanny locked position or whatever. You can get your ice cream on the house and we essentially have conversations like explaining what Juicebox is or talking to project owners. Eventually we can go through the onboarding thing. We can invite project creators to talk throughout the week who may have expressed interest in starting a Juicebox project, or transitioning an ongoing project onto Juicebox. </p><p>It’s like piggybacking what Morganstern’s is already doing as well as the NFTNYC and trying to flex our capability for Banny and Juicebox material into a hyper specific location, and meanwhile make it all about project creators.
The approximate budget would be around 10k for the week perhaps including free ice creams.
The DAONYC event by DAOplanet is on June 24 -25, right after the NFTNYC, so we might try to make the two events work together in some way.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="7quizz-time">7.Quizz time:<a class="hash-link" href="#7quizz-time" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In the statements below, two are true, one is a lie.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>“Juicebox in the words of” is a series that highlights JB community members in interview form. Learn about members’ roles at JB and what makes them tick.</em></p><p><em>Zeugh</em> <em>is a contributor to the JB space as a community manager and a straight up OG. He has all the trappings of a proverbial hype-man, and a knack for bringing a party and good vibes wherever he goes. He’s upbeat with an excellent sense of humor, and his sarcasm game is through the roof. He works tirelessly to help bring the JB community together, and to bring those JB vibes to every corner of the globe. Read on to learn a bit more about this sarcastic human teddy bear.</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-it-changed-since-youve-been-here">How'd you get started with JB, and how has it changed since you've been here?<a class="hash-link" href="#howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-it-changed-since-youve-been-here" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I started at JB around Aug/June 2021. DAOs amazed me and i had my eyes on crypto for a while… but when I found out DAOs existed I was very excited to work with them. I joined a discord server and got involved with Tiles DAO, and eventually just explored more. I wasn’t in JB way at the beginning, but I did join in the first week after release. When the question came up that a community manager was needed, I put my name out there. I had never been a comm manager per se, but had been doing comm management for other products I was helping release and so I figured I’d take it on, got voted in, and hit the ground running. I started</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-youre-an-og">So you’re an OG.<a class="hash-link" href="#so-youre-an-og" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I joined in week 1 of JB, back at FC1. Although regarding crypto as a whole, I’m pretty much a newbie. JB was the first project I really got involved in and put my hands on.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wow-thats-nuts-youve-seen-the-evolution-of-jb-from-start-to-right-now-would-you-say-its-unrecognizable">Wow, that’s nuts— you’ve seen the evolution of JB from start to right now. Would you say it’s unrecognizable?<a class="hash-link" href="#wow-thats-nuts-youve-seen-the-evolution-of-jb-from-start-to-right-now-would-you-say-its-unrecognizable" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>From the beginning? I wouldn’t say unrecognizable because I think some of the core values of transparency, building out in the open, and great vibes have been around since day one. The core values have not changed, and that’s beautiful.</p><p>I think of it like a sapling and tree, just as they are different, they are also the same.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-would-you-describe-your-role-at-jb">How would you describe your role at JB?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-would-you-describe-your-role-at-jb" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A confusing one, firstly, but also a very interesting one. Rarely are two days the same. There is a lot of time spent online in chats and severs, whether the Chinese chats to try to understand community issues, or in other servers to learn new tools they’re using, practices they have, and how they engage/reward/manage a sustainable growth.</p><p>Lately we’ve pushed hard on trying to automate governance with guys like filipv, Phytann, jigglyjamz, lazervike and others, and Canu has been heavily involved in this as well.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-has-it-been-like-working-with-the-chinese-community-and-their-role-at-jb">What has it been like working with the Chinese community, and their role at JB?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-has-it-been-like-working-with-the-chinese-community-and-their-role-at-jb" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>It’s one of the better things that happened to JB ever, but at the same time definitely one of the biggest challenges. Bringing our Chinese members together in a governance process where we all get the power to decide what we do is a complex thing, but it’s exactly what makes us so critical and diverse in what we build. We have to do good stuff– not sensibly good to my taste or American or European tastes, or to Chinese tastes, but it has to be good stuff across the board. That’s very challenging to pull off, but at the same time we’re all a part of the community.</p><p>When the community first came, I remember I would jump in there with google translate to try to make sense of the chats going on in discord. Man, it was so suddenly so many new members, and we had to try to reach out and make those connections. It was an exiting and also exhausting time, especially since google translate can only do so much. I do have to say one of the members who has been a killer and God in moderating the Chinese community, getting them informed and engaged, is twodam. That guy is a beast and I appreciate him so much.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-idea-of-you-sitting-in-discord-with-google-translate-and-trying-to-understand-chinese-is-absolutely-hilarious-to-me">The idea of you sitting in Discord with google translate and trying to understand Chinese is absolutely hilarious to me.<a class="hash-link" href="#the-idea-of-you-sitting-in-discord-with-google-translate-and-trying-to-understand-chinese-is-absolutely-hilarious-to-me" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Let me tell you— now we have the translate bot. It automatically translates. But that day when we got that huge influx of members, it was 3am and my phone starting beeping, beeping, beeping, and I was like ok, silent mode, I’m not working tonight, this is my one night off.</p><p>But it didn’t stop! So I got back to my comp and there were more than 1k new members, all of them Mandarin speakers, and all were over every channel– and up to that day we didn’t have a single Mandarin channel, so I spent the whole night with google translate writing FAQs, basic guides on how to solve the most common questions, translated hundreds of Q’s and ranked them with what were the most relevant answers, and I think it was nicholas and someone else who was in the twitter spaces that joined and were able to pitch in and help. Shout out to those guys and everyone who helped early on with that, it was such a huge task and everyone stepped up. Eventually we even found some university students from the US that we knew who were Chinese and we asked them to translate asap, and that helped a lot too. Now we have really amazing translator teams, the of course the amazing twodam who kills it every day, and so we’ve found a good stride.</p><p>Twodam is amazing, I can’t say enough good things. He ended up in this position of managing the greatest share of governance (by population) and is doing it incredibly well. I’m about convinced that twdam is a team– not a guy, a whole team– because the guy does contracts, community, translates, I mean he’s absolutely incredible.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="where-are-all-the-assholes-at-jb">Where are all the assholes at JB?<a class="hash-link" href="#where-are-all-the-assholes-at-jb" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>That’s a very good question, actually. The main thing on that that fascinates me is that I’ve spent countless hours crunching analytics data on our conversations, running our bots, and so far I haven’t found them either. Idk why, but they are just not around I guess. The funny thing is we’re in the crypto space— people being obnoxious is like breakfast, but somehow at JB we don’t attract these kinds of people.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-something-somebody-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you">What’s something somebody would be surprised to learn about you?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-something-somebody-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I was a comp sci undergrad for 3 years, that’s when I first heard about crypto, and even so it took me 5 years to ever engage in my first transaction (which was in bitcoin!) to actually get into crypto because I was completely against burning the amazon. I was a very critical person of crypto for a good while. I was misinformed.</p><p>I get addicted to hobbies; 2 years ago I was living in a small house in the middle of the woods. I spent about one year living there, talking to my cats or the monkeys who would come to try to steal my food. I was developing digital products and tending to the gardens since I love gardening. I loved the nature, the no-plastic environment, just me and plants, no eating meat. That passed now, I’m back to the animal eating part of life and living around big buildings and concrete and using plastic bags, but that was definitely a life-changing part of my last few years.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-what-changed-the-amazon-can-just-burn-to-the-ground">So what changed? The amazon can just burn to the ground?<a class="hash-link" href="#so-what-changed-the-amazon-can-just-burn-to-the-ground" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I stopped listening to the news and started reading some articles.&nbsp; After you read the numbers/data you understand that that’s not what’s happening. I was living in the middle of nature trying to find out how possible it was for someone living in society to have the smallest impact in nature– that was the goal of going there– to see how simple/non-violent towards nature I could live without leaving behind civilization and a modern world. I started reading everything I could in every area, so I learned a huge amount and cleared up a lot of misconceptions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fascinating-whos-your-fav-contributor-and-why-is-it-zom_bae">Fascinating. Who’s your fav contributor, and why is it Zom_Bae?<a class="hash-link" href="#fascinating-whos-your-fav-contributor-and-why-is-it-zom_bae" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Haha. I think this gets me into a tight spot here. Although Zom_Bae is terrific, I don’t think I can give her the prize without sharing it with filipv and twodam. I will not even include jango in this one just because that is obvious.</p><p>I can’t choose man, I have the blessing of a very amazing team to work with. If I had to pick, I would share my favorite contributor in four people– Filip, Jango, Twodam, and Zom_Bae. If I had to pick one, I’d go with Zom_Bae. She’s amazing. And the red rocket banny pfp! Zom_Bae does wonders in lots of micro areas around JB community - I would not trust anyone more than her nowadays to be the one who receives and onboards both partners and community members, contributor-wannabes, and everyone in between who needs guidance to navigate our complex environment.</p><p>jango has always been a steward for good culture, has always been bringing some perspectives of open criticism/honest debate since the beginning.</p><p>Filip is a monster– a complete gigabrain going from governance to some automation here and there and finding good minds to help every single area he touches– there’s not an issue I don’t se him going around. Twodam I’ve talked about more than anyone in this inteveriew– it’s well deserved. Bridging two different communities while also building data queries to better observe community trends, and making it look effortless, it’s just amazing…</p><p>But then there’s Mieos and Sage with WAGMI studios and all the vibes– Sage is definitely underrated! A huge shout-out to her and the vibes that we get from Banny and that we get from all the juicy fruits that she brings to life with her art. Banny’s something else.</p><p>Nicholas, filipv, unicorn and 0xSTVG are fucking rocking it, doing amazing at governance issues, really taking the helm on things.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="and-how-about-that-awesome-guy-who-writes-the-banny-histories-huh">And how about that awesome guy who writes the Banny histories, huh?<a class="hash-link" href="#and-how-about-that-awesome-guy-who-writes-the-banny-histories-huh" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>But he’s just in the house, I mean he’s around here and there... I’ll mention him maybe in the next one. Haha.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="okay-no-hard-feelings-besides-feeding-wild-monkeys-do-you-have-any-other-interesting-hobbies">Okay, no hard feelings.

I am the apex of ADHD in a human being. That’s why I tend to work in the night because everyone else is sleeping and that’s less things to get distracted with. I’m kind of a workaholic; I engage a good part of my hobbies like they’re work. I played (semi-professionaly) League of Legends for a while. Very low-tier stuff though.</p><p>I love gardening. I used to have an ant farm; I would catch ant queens in mating season and I started my own ant farm. I raised some ants.</p><p>My hobby is changing hobbies– I have 3-month sprints where I have hyper-focus in something, study a lot and research a lot, get super nerdy, and then I move on to the next thing. I’ve been through organic chemistry– making my own hygiene products. Star wars– reading all I could in the expanded universe. Wicca magic. Cocktails.

What’s the favorite thing you’re looking forward to?<a class="hash-link" href="#thats-awesome-whats-the-favorite-thing-youre-looking-forward-to" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I’ll have to split the answer in two. The first - watching how crypto changes the world. I’m gonna play a part and I want to play the best part I can. I used to say in my twitter, “I am here to make sure the next big social network is not owned by a corporation, but is co-owned”. I want to see the power of open data, public ledgers, collective ownership over the digital assets that currently rule over people’s days most of the time, and so much more. I want to watch as that unfolds and try to play a part, and I think it will happen in a massive way.</p><p>As for myself, I’m really really keen to creating those bridges between people building stuff and people that need stuff built. I’ll be going nomad for a while and traveling to try to find a way to get a local communities to organize and find solutions through the tech they’re creating. Local communities are powerful and we’re finally at a point where digital communities are also hitting that kind of strength. If we can merge local and digital communities we can really change things. When the people making products, the politicians making promises, etc., are also the people who are living in a community, they can’t just say they’ll do things and not do them. Suddenly there is accountability, and things get better. I want to build a solar-punk future. It sounds crazy, but I used to say, “I’m not crazy, I’m just hopeful.”</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As many of you may have noticed, the question of compensation has come up recently in the discord (linked <a href="https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/963551788823375932/963551856091627522" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). It was an exceptionally valuable discussion that really highlighted how tricky the question concerning compensation is, both at JB specifically and in the web3 DAO space as a whole.</p><p>Central to this question and perhaps a source of equivocation is this: what precisely is Juicebox?</p><p>People looking at Juicebox like a startup, assuming it will exist like startups in the web2 world, may be quick to advocate for low salaries. After all, you don’t want high salaries if you are looking to pump up value in a company that you want to sell. This is the case with classic startups that are seeded with VC and created with the intent of profit as their final goal.</p><p>But you can also look at Juicebox like a grass-roots company– still profit driven, but not looking to sell. This would be in-line with your classic examples of companies that went big– think Bill Gates dropping out of college to create Microsoft, or Mark Zuckerberg doing the same with Facebook. In these cases, the goal was not to pump value and then sell; rather, the goal was to build first, and only after that to reap the rewards down the line. When Mark Zuckerberg made facebook, Myspace was the biggest name in town. In a few short years, it became an afterthought, and Mark Zuckerberg became the reptilian overlord we know him as today. He was in it for the long-haul, and it paid off for him.</p><p>And finally, you can look at Juicebox as a community. In this schema, it’s a collection of people all pulling in the same direction. The people who see Juicebox this way are quick to tell you that profit doesn’t really enter their minds too much, nor does a potential long-term promise of riches and private yachts. Rather, these people just like the people, the vibe, and the sense of being a part of something greater than themselves.</p><p>All this a long-winded way to point out that, if we ask the three people above about compensation, we’re likely to get three very different answers. Furthermore, we’re even more likely to equivocate the word at hand.</p><p>For instance: at Juicebox, are we compensating for services rendered, or are we acknowledging people’s efforts <em>through</em> compensation? Are we disbursing funds based on how profit-driven companies pay their employees, or are we giving pieces of the pie, ie JBX, to stake future promise and voice into our contributors? And in either case, how are we valuing contributors based on their roles differently?</p><p>And then there is a question of effort spent working– that is, is it even fair to tie compensation to how hard one works. Take for instance classic capitalist models. You may know someone who works hard and makes 50k per year. You may know someone who works hard and makes 200k a year. You may wonder if one person is truly working “harder” than the other. Maybe so, maybe not. But then take Elon Musk, who is worth 300 billion dollars, give or take. Is it fair to say that, in comparison to our 200k-per-year example, Elon is working 1.5 million times harder? Or compared to our 50K example, that he’s working six million times harder? We see from this reductio ad absurdem that equating value with how hard one works tends toward fallacy.</p><p>And so we arrive back and square one. What is compensation, truly? What is fair compensation? Is comparison the thief of joy, or should we look to others to determine our own worth? Marx said: from each according to his ability, to each according to his need. An honor system in other words– I am a contributor doing X in a city where I need Y to live comfortably, and I’m asking for Y. Is this the solution– a commune where wealth is shared according to what people self-report they need? It doesn’t take a much to point out the room for abuse there.</p><p>Perhaps this is the central point: complicated, worthwhile endeavors are messy. There aren’t simple answers to these questions, and there shouldn’t be. The fact that we’re doing something worthwhile is underpinned by the fact that we’re even having these conversations, and so authentically and transparently at that. Like great art, you can’t expect people to come away agreeing that this discussion means the same thing, or that it’s solved. But what can be said is that our attitude toward the discussion should reflect ourselves authentically, and should show our steadfast determination to working together, to community and to teamwork. Oscar Wilde said, “A cynic is a man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.” We should take these words to heart and resolve to never get lost in just the numbers.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2022-05-11T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1. Intro]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-intro">1. Intro<a class="hash-link" href="#1-intro" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-front-end-update-from-aeolian">2. Front end update from @aeolian:<a class="hash-link" href="#2-front-end-update-from-aeolian" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We had another good week, and pretty much on track for a Mainnet launch in the next 3-4days. We started a feature freeze 36h ago, which means not merging anything unless it’s a critical bug, none of which is found, to allow us to merge a big PR that supports a new subgraph. New subgraph is currently indexing the mainnet, now it’s a waiting game that needs logical coordination to get things to happen. Once that’s in, we are basically ready to launch V2 on mainnet. The good thing is, that the launch is not a one-way door, if we have major issues, we can always switch back to V1 to fix the issues and switch back to V2 after that. It has been a much bigger effort than we all imagined, but it is now coming to a close here.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-quick-inventory-check-by-jango">3. Quick inventory check by @jango:<a class="hash-link" href="#3-quick-inventory-check-by-jango" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Not sure if it’s useful but I think the past few days after V2 has been up, folks have been more future and forward looking. There’s been a lot of ideas coming up that people are prototyping and playing with. Sometimes people are in tune with things happening while sometimes not. I just want to make sure that we all somewhere are aware of what’s on our mind and where different projects are at.</p><p>1) V2 contracts (deployed) : V2 contracts have been shared quite a few times in Town Hall. These have been deployed in the 4th iteration which is feeling great. So, our products are basically done in their initial capacity and in the needs of contracts. I just want to make sure it’s communicated out enough so folks know how to use it.</p><p>2) Docs (deployed, iterating): The docs are started by @filipv and a bunch of stuff has been added from a technical perspective. Those are done as well and constantly iterated on.
@filipv: I am very excited to help centralize a lot of resources to build extensions to the protocol, and it is like a repository of information about everything related to Juicebox).
@jango: Big shouts for helps in setting that up in the beginning and shouts for WAGMI studio, @sage and @mieos for starting to create a whole-worldly vibe for what a repository of higher knowledge could look like.</p><p>3) Fee extension (formalizing): This is a solution to use V2 tooling to route incoming payments to JuiceboxDAO to best yielding places for JBX, on AMM or first party issuance mechanical. It is looking great and we are wrapping up tests and playing with optimization, kind of in a formalizing stage.</p><p>4) veBanny contracts (formalizing): This is a way of staking JBX for an NFT ve position, which is locking your JBX over time to have a new kind of accounting primitive to use for governance. I hope we can align decision-making with a longer term community interest in this way. Alongside it, a lot of art is being experimented by the WAGMI team, tankbottoms and natasha. This job is also being formalized, we are trying to piece together, according to CURVE ve contracts, how we might do delegation in this scheme. It’s very promising.</p><p>5) V1→V2 migration terminal (prototyped, formalizable): Once V2 is up, projects can have a V2 token issued if they choose to operate on V2 as well as V1, which is what JuiceboxDAO will do. We are going to prototype a terminal where the V2 treasury will accept the V1 treasury token as payment and issue its V2 version one for one (1:1). It, to some extent, works within the mental model of how Juicebox treasuries are working, and we are trying to manage the migration in that way.</p><p>6) NFT market (prototyped): It is a topic that has been lingering for a while and happened in conversations quite many times and might be on the horizon. It’s a set of contracts that allow folks to list NFT with the sales routed through a particular Juicebox treasury or a set of treasuries. The goal of this project is, instead of having the pay button as the way to pay projects, anyone could upload an NFT that could basically serve as the pay button. Someone could just buy the NFT and the funds would be routed to the treasury. This is in effect a more engaging pay button that is extended to do the NFT related treasury things. This is also prototyped, and it seems we also have a few prototypes from @tankbottoms as well. It still need some design iterations.</p><p>7) V2 versioning fire drill (prototyping): There’s an idea floating around once we get V2 up to sooner rather than later organize how versioning might work on V2, like we might deploy subsequent version of the payment terminal V2, which is a feature of V2 as hyperforkability. People can roll their treasuries and migrate between terminals. Might be interesting to be right off the bat, before some happenings or pressure, to migrate from one terminal to another slightly optimized one. This is not really a big deal but more so to get the cadence of feeling confident in how we might organize files. It’s not an urgent matter, but we should think of doing it instead of waiting till things get chaotic and we’re driven by necessity to migrate, by then things tend to be more delicate.</p><p>8) 1:1 terminals for L2 strategy (pre-prototyping): The L2 strategy allows projects to manage treasuries on not just mainnet but any other L2, then to have their tokens organized across chains, taking redemption into account, etc. There is a good design for it, it just needs to be prototyped. </p><p>9) Subscription terminal (pre-prototyping): It’s not really worth touching on but @jigglyjam brought up a cool use case that might be fun to sail for.</p><p>10) Juicebox reverse ENS registry (pre-prototyping):With the V2 tool box available, front end brought up a good point regarding Juicebox reverse ENS registry. In V1 we had handles for projects which is great in the short term, but it has a whole lot we need to think about for a long-term perspective. In V2, we just started with project IDs, so that people can build things on top of it. Front end has already accommodated ENS support for projects to use as URLs to access their treasury, but there’s couple of things in the UI that need to be nicer if there's an additional Juicebox reverse ENS registry. </p><p>11) Treasure hunt:
@mieos has been working on a treasure hunt on cryptovoxels.com which is pretty exciting.
updates on treasure hunt by @wackozacco:
We are trying to experiment to coordinate something special with V2 promotion. Please go to the 3rd floor of the parcel, where there are clues for seed phrases of the treasure chest. There is already 150k JBX inside the wallet. After V2, @mieos will set up another discord to give clues for the decoder. We try to plan some more scavenger hunt type of things.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-nance-bot-by-jigglyjams">4. Nance bot by @jigglyjams:<a class="hash-link" href="#4-nance-bot-by-jigglyjams" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Nance bot has been up and running since the last Funding Cycle, and I am working on scheduling it now. I am definitely interested in how subscription payments tied into it for future DAOs. Nance is like automating the governance pipeline, e.g. Juicebox has a notion-discord-snapshot pipeline, this feels like their valves, and also works for other Juicebox projects using similar structure. The notion page by @filipv and @jigglyjams is <a href="https://www.notion.so/juicebox/Governance-Automation-Overview-772dc68367a741fe9d96f768997a28eb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p><p>Utilizing nance bot is currently through CanuDAO, I am planning to use the subscription contract for future DAOs to pay for the use of nance bot.</p><p>@jango: I am interested in taking a step in the subscription terminal, it could be an interesting project and a decent entry in building Juicebox extensions too.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5-podcast-updates-by-matthewbrooks-and-brileigh">5. Podcast updates by @matthewbrooks and @brileigh<a class="hash-link" href="#5-podcast-updates-by-matthewbrooks-and-brileigh" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We have just posted the 1st podcast with @dropnerd from SharkDAO, currently we are editing the 2nd episode which was recorded with @drgorilla and @zhape about Moody’sDAO, and working on finishing that up. I think the results are good so far, and we are open to constructive feedback.
@jango: I suppose Moody’sDAO should be another project worth mentioning here. We are trying to make everyone aware of what’s happening, say it out loud the priorities, and see how to nudge each other towards bringing things over the finish line one at a time. Surely everything is making an impressive progress over the past months, some of them are really hefty projects that are not easy to spec out let alone bring it to the finish line.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="6-presentation-by-tankbottoms-and-filipv">6. Presentation by @tankbottoms and @filipv<a class="hash-link" href="#6-presentation-by-tankbottoms-and-filipv" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In general, this presentation talks about different objectives based on the foundation which is helping people confidently run programmable and community fund treasuries, from start to scale openly on Ethereum.</p><p>A lot of people are using Juicebox so far because these are short term project instances which Juicebox is amazing for. You go to the website and in a minute you can have a treasury set up with the project’s page. But a lot of projects are more oriented towards longer term development, and would want to have their own website and an interface custom suited to what they need to do. Something @aeolian brought up today is super valuable in building out different libraries of components which makes it super easy for projects like Flamingo or Muse0 to interface with the Juicebox protocol.</p><p>Part of enabling people to build longer term oriented projects is to help approach legal things in a way that makes people more confident. We can add terms of use and a privacy policy for juicebox.money and other front end. And we are also working with dao-lawfirm.eth, the one @tankbottoms is working with, to set up some accessible packages for Juicebox projects and potential templates and generic policies which will hopefully help people build on Juicebox with more legal peace of mind.</p><p>Another idea is to bring in some DEFI capability by using some of the functionalities that V2 provides and we can start by doing stablecoin, overtime we can work with different services providers to set up bot terminals which people can add as a payout and then be able to interface with different DEFI protocols. If JuiceboxDAO is focused on treasury management for DAOs with long term orientation, being able to diversify and split ETH into a bunch of stuff is probably more attractive than just keeping ETH in the treasury in terms of minimizing risk.</p><p>Another part will be genesis NFT creation. I just did the pull request for the NFT delegate. The first 100 people that contribute to your project should get an commemorative NFT or people who contribute more can get the NFT. The delegate is a new function or a feature in V2 that executes an arbitrary smart contract or basically does whatever you want whenever someone pays or redeems with a Juicebox treasury. </p><p>Q: When this stuff is implemented, how much longer is it to launch a project? Are you going to have the option to not use these things by bypassing them, like, if i don’t want them but just something simple, can I click a button to bypass?</p><p>@filipv: I wonder if it makes sense to implement these things as an optional library or even on a separate website from the main juicebox.money interface. If you want to do NFT, you can go to the other website.</p><p>There are a ton of functionalities tank has been working on. Like this NFT market is to some extent extending the functionality of minting NFT which projects can use, and contributions on the market place can be sent to the DAO treasury. </p><p>The bot terminal basically creates treasuries which will interface with different DEFI protocols and we can create custom strategies to diversify assets and to manage treasury as easy as adding another payout. What’s great is that there is no fee in between projects in V2. The idea is to make it sticky and make people want to build in Juicebox because it’ll give them access to these tools such as NFT and DEFI stuff like that. First these are built for JuiceboxDAO, but eventually hopefully will be accessible to the entire ecosystem.</p><p>@jango: We should continue to go out and prioritize and try to refactor until the right way  to present it to folks, in a way that preserves the users’ focus as they are trying to find out how to set up projects and achieve certain things. I am curious how you see a lot of these new features playing in one place because a lot of mocks belong to juicebox.money or navigatable from the same UI. Maybe this is a question that we should keep in mind as a group going forward. There are going to be some competing for space in the interface, or competing for attention. </p><p>@filipv: In my opinion, one super valuable work flow would be to compartmentalize all of these into APPs. we can build this library of extensions in the Juicebox protocol. If you want to use it for your project, you can click “add”, and people can put in their custom contract. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="7--on-gorilla-marketing">7.  On Gorilla Marketing:<a class="hash-link" href="#7--on-gorilla-marketing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>@filipv: I want to mention the Gorilla marketing that @Zeugh is up to. There’s a lot of discussion of physical presence at conferences. I think it has a lot of potential. Anyone interested can reach out to us.</p><p>@Zeugh: That’s something I am excited for. I’ve been talking a little more this week with @felixander and @casstoshi about joining some forces to make it better by integrating gorilla marketing, pulp writing and search optimization. I believe we are going to have some nice news soon on getting better visibility. I was reading about treasure management, talked with @twodam, @jango and @drgorilla about the runway we have in ETH. And one of the solutions I believe is to get more projects inside and make that treasury grow. So ETH goes down, treasury goes up. It makes a whole lot of sense to me that marketing, writing and visibility can play a good part in that.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="8-on-user-flow">8. On user flow.<a class="hash-link" href="#8-on-user-flow" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>@filipv: Does anybody have any thoughts on user flow, and what that would look like as these extensions are built out?</p><p>@jango: I am gonna say these are gonna come together over several weeks. This will continue to be a topic in subsequent town halls. We will keep revisiting.</p><p>@nicholas: I think maybe it’s interesting to think the creation flow could be people coming from very different points of view. We may be having an easier time building a treasury set up for their use cases. Then maybe those are rolled into this modular interface content. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="9-quizz-time">9.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, May 3rd (Wednesday May 4th local Chinese time), some Juicebox members (including jango, Zeugh, peri, filipv and your favorite author, to name just a few) engaged in an open discord call with Chinese-speaking JB community members and contributors. This article recaps some of the main points discussed. Also a huge shout-out to Zhape for his excellent on-the-fly translations!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="translation-needs">Translation needs<a class="hash-link" href="#translation-needs" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The translation efforts are coming back underway as JB has overhauled its documents over the past few weeks. One area of concern was in how to best achieve accurate translations that can be written engagingly. The need for accurate translators, particularly who are comfortable working from English to Chinese, was underscored by Zhape. If you are comfortable translating into Chinese fluently and would like to contribute to translation efforts, reach out to Zotico in the #translation channel.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="guerilla-marketing-campaign-and-community-building">Guerilla Marketing Campaign and Community Building<a class="hash-link" href="#guerilla-marketing-campaign-and-community-building" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Zeugh gave a brief highlight of some intended efforts at marketing and community building. Currently, there have been discussions to send some Juicebox contributors to Crypto or NFT conferences where they can network and spread the word about Juicebox. Possible eventual speaking opportunities at conferences, or sponsorships of conferences, are also being discussed, but at the moment the goal is to start small and see if we can spread the word about Juicebox and make meaningful connections between communities, or create opportunities for people to open projects on the Juicebox platform.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="translating-outreachcommunity-content">Translating outreach/community content<a class="hash-link" href="#translating-outreachcommunity-content" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>One area discussed was the importance of trying to make it a priority to translate into Chinese blog posts, interviews, or other materials that will help bridge the gap between our Chinese-speaking and English-speaking communities. For instance, an article such as this one that simply updates the community at large on a recent discord call, or an article that announces major changes coming with V2, would be excellent opportunities to inform our Chinese-speaking readers and to open the opportunity to gain feedback from them.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-state-of-v2">The state of V2<a class="hash-link" href="#the-state-of-v2" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>jango gave some insights on how the V2 protocol is coming along. Front-end of the protocol is still under development and coming along nicely, and in the mean time fine-tuning measures in the back-end continue to ensure a smooth rollout. The V2 protocol will allow many creative opportunities to build extensions, and offer more tools to project creation. So far early reception has been very good.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tokenomics-strategies">Tokenomics strategies<a class="hash-link" href="#tokenomics-strategies" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The question of how tokens should be disbursed, traded and valued also came up. The goal of ensuring that a project received the best rate of JBX per ETH is being discussed and worked on. Practically, this would mean that if a better JBX rate existed from an AMM, a project creator would receive that rate JBX at the AMM exchange rate. While JBX currently has low liquidity, one line of thinking is that such a system, which would necessarily drive traffic to such AMM’s, would serve as a mechanism to build those liquidity pools. Importantly, the impetus for such a process starting will likely come as Juicebox incentivizes these opportunities.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="voting-equity">Voting equity<a class="hash-link" href="#voting-equity" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Another core topic of discussion was around voting equity in the current DAO governance. The question centered around how to strike a balance between early contributing members, such as jango, who have very large sums of JBX and thus have tremendous voting power, and members who may be contributing heavily but are newer, and thus have far lower voting power. This is a catch-22, but it is important to note that this imbalance is certainly aware to early contributors such as peri, jango and others. In the case of per and jango, they do not engage in voting for this reason (both were quick to point out). One solution is to continue issuing JBX, which will give more voting power to more individuals, but this also flies squarely against certain opinions to completely stop JBX issuance. It is a complex situation that has a lot of moving parts, and is inextricably linked to the JBX issuance/AMM situation mentioned above. Ultimately the thinking is that with these new changes, solutions may present themselves and we will see growth and directions in these domains.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="main-takeaways">Main Takeaways<a class="hash-link" href="#main-takeaways" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>This call provided important information and helped streamline communication between the English-speaking and Chinese-speaking Juicebox member communities. The nature of questions remained substantive throughout and finding a cadence to have such calls seems like a good strategy moving forward. A huge thank-you to our members, both English- and Chinese-speakers, for taking the time to hop on this call and for having such open and transparent discussions. And again a huge thank-you to Zhape, who translated and managed the discussion and kept a good flow going!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Filipv, our very own JB wunderkind and the fellow that onboarded me into such a welcoming and brilliant community, made the grave error of agreeing to record himself playing VR miniature golf with me the other day. This resulted in shenanigans, as one might expect, but it also gave us a glimpse into the recent happenings filipv has been engaged with.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="filipv-where-is-he-now">Filipv: where is he now?<a class="hash-link" href="#filipv-where-is-he-now" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Filipv is still comfortably engaged with JB initiatives around governance, populating the YouTube channel, and serving as MC for town hall’s, among many other things. You can find filipv in the general chat always helping out, or across the discord helping to craft and curate threads and proposals as needed. It was his invisible hand that guided this very article into the ether that is our web3 blog.</p><p>On the heels of an engaging discussion that took place in the after-party of the last JB town hall, I also decided to ask filipv some pointed questions about his feelings on mayonnaise. His answers, as you may expect, did not disappoint.</p><p>And finally and perhaps most importantly, filipv announced that he is working on his very own NFT music project. It’s all very hush hush at the moment, but he looks forward to sharing more when the time is right.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-horses-mouth">The Horse’s Mouth<a class="hash-link" href="#the-horses-mouth" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>If you’d like to delve further into any of the revelations above, please find a carefully curated video of filipv being interviewed about his ambitions, his mic technique, and mayonnaise. He didn’t end up winning the golf game, but he’s clearly winning at life. And please excuse the awful audio— my mic technique is nothing to write home about.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>If you held JBX before 2022-02-23 and have not done so already, <a href="https://airdrop.juicebox.money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claim your JBX</a>!</em></p><p>We've seen some super interesting results from the <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/juicebox-benefits-program-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicebox Benefits Airdrop</a> which launched last month. <a href="https://arcx.money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ARCx</a> has worked with us to collate and summarise some preliminary findings from the airdrop. Results below!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="definitions">Definitions<a class="hash-link" href="#definitions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>To fully comprehend the findings, it helps to quickly define the terminology used in our analysis.</p><p>Most of these findings centralise around a concept called the "Retention Rate". The retention rate is defined as the <strong>lowest JBX balance for an address after the airdrop</strong>. To better understand this, let's use an example:</p><p><code>0x123</code> claims 100 JBX tokens from the airdrop. They then go on to sell 30 of their tokens immediately after claiming. This address then waits a week, and buys back the originally sold 30 tokens. In this scenario <code>0x123</code> would have a retention rate of 70%, even after buying back the tokens, as it is the greatest amount of tokens sold after the claim.</p><p>This logic ensures that per address the retention rate can only go down over time.</p><p>The second concept to understand is the "Average Retention Rate". Many of these graphs aggregate the retention rates across all claimers in the airdrop. The average retention rate is defined as <strong>the average of all the retention rates for all addresses whom have claimed already</strong>. So, again using an example, if 10 addresses claimed the airdrop each day, then the average retention rate on day 1 would only consider the first 10 address and not any of the addresses who claimed on day 2, day 3, etc.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="findings">Findings<a class="hash-link" href="#findings" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The first graph shows retention rates 28 days after several major airdrops. The Juicebox Benefits Airdrop had unprecedented levels of hodling!</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/juicebox_retention_snapshot-f42d17e69558ce6505f0d04a86444e70.png" width="606" height="374" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The next graph also shows retention rates, but instead shows them over time. After a brief selloff, retention was remarkably stable.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/juicebox_retention_over_time-bb0d71c40e63731e296d0e4cbc4100a4.png" width="606" height="387" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Next, we consider this same retention rate over time broken down across the 3 different score chorts (see <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/jbdao.eth/proposal/0xd10c56f453851063665241417642352beaf8816aca062c29f98b1f5154ff3cdd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JBP-114</a>). Interestingly, the cohort with scores between 53-200 had the second highest retention rate, beating out the 201-300 cohort by ~15% at times.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/juicebox_retention_by_cohort-eae2713a86cbbff13df4d4de667b8b4a.png" width="606" height="387" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Finally, we looked at how quickly each cohort claimed their JBX. Interestingly, the 53-200 tier fared better than the 201-300 tier in this metric as well. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/juicebox_claims-925e755b482e0cdf2952d552faf16455.png" width="612" height="387" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Thank you to everybody who helped make this airdrop happen. More information and analysis will be coming soon!</p>]]></content>

I’ve been in software development for a minute, and I met some anons who wanted to do this public good DAO, which is now called MovementDAO. It’s part seeding start-ups, part non-profit, part social movements.  In researching platforms to work with I found two which I liked the most, OpenLaw’s TributeDAO Framework and Juicebox. </p><p>TributeDAO we updated all the tooling and added DeFi, and at the end felt it was not as accessible as we would have liked. We also took Juicebox forked it and launched it on Polygon (where Matic is used), which was more what we were looking for.  However, we are not the kind of cats to fork and do stuff, its open source and its fair game, but we contribute, add value and divide up the work, so it seemed right to contribute to helping through v2.  </p><p>One place it was mentioned where we could help was figure out the BannyVerse situation. I pinged Wagmi’s Mieos and started collaborating with constructing Banny to be mintable, worked on the TokenUriResolver how the veBannys were going to be selected, and planning on the BannyVerse would unfold NFT-wise. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thats-fascinating-you-seem-to-be-well-versed-on-the-technical-side-of-this-stuff-in-your-opinion-how-do-daos-protect-themselves-from-bad-actorssabotage"><strong>That’s fascinating, you seem to be well-versed on the technical side of this stuff. In your opinion, how do DAO’s protect themselves from bad actors/sabotage?</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#thats-fascinating-you-seem-to-be-well-versed-on-the-technical-side-of-this-stuff-in-your-opinion-how-do-daos-protect-themselves-from-bad-actorssabotage" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A few DAOs have added a veto contract or function in existing contracts that can veto any pending proposals.  This can be provided to a law firm, also called service provider, or retained by the founders until they revoke the right on chain at a later date. In other words, it’s designed to ensure nothing crazy happens.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="interesting-it-seems-like-that-mechanism-kind-of-runs-against-the-philosophy-of-what-a-dao-is-doesnt-it-how-do-you-strike-a-balance-between-control-and-decentralization">Interesting.

This whole space is a one large expensive experiment and so you really don’t know what may happen, so its safe to be prudent.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-always-think-of-daocrypto-time-similar-to-dog-years-and-aging-like-one-month-of-time-in-a-dao-has-gotta-be-at-least-6-months-or-a-year-at-a-regular-irl-company-you-and-i-of-course-both-help-as-contributors-to-wagmi-productions-how-would-you-describe-your-role-at-jb-and-wagmi-after-this-first-6-weeks-or-so">I always think of DAO/Crypto time similar to dog-years and aging: like one month of time in a DAO has gotta be at least 6 months or a year at a regular IRL company. You and I of course both help as contributors to Wagmi productions.

I wrote the Juicebox TokenURI Resolver for the veBanny and make sure the composite Banny and appropriate metadata are deployed on IPFS. Additionally and more importantly, when Juicebox token holders go to stake their Banny and enter the Bannyverse, I aim to enable the experience to mint a unique Banny with anything from Hattori Hanzo to AK-47. A banana has got to defend himself. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-always-ask-about-where-all-the-assholes-are-it-seems-like-so-many-talented-people-working-together-should-bring-a-clash-of-egos-where-are-the-assholes"><strong>I always ask about where all the assholes are, it seems like so many talented people working together should bring a clash of egos.

I also think people who stick around are very talented, the Notion docs do a pretty good job about making it clear that you have to contribute before seeking a one-time or reoccurring payout.  All the contributors are pretty cool about their talent. And that kind of sets the atmosphere.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="between-you-and-me-and-the-rest-of-the-internet-whos-your-favorite-contributor-and-why-is-it-mieos">Between you and me and the rest of the internet, who’s your favorite contributor, and why is it Mieos?<a class="hash-link" href="#between-you-and-me-and-the-rest-of-the-internet-whos-your-favorite-contributor-and-why-is-it-mieos" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I think WAGMI makes it clear you can add a lot of value even if it’s not code. WAGMI’s pixel ninjas, 60 Minutes style interviews, and the enabling of the BannyVerse reinforces that throughout whatever the problem, we are all here to have fun; and reminds us all to no take yourself too seriously, and that says a lot. Mieos is very humble, even though he’s been around in the space for a long time and basically the OG JB whale. He’s pretty rad.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-a-project-within-or-outside-of-jb-that-youre-really-looking-forward-to-in-the-future">What’s a project (within or outside of JB) that you’re really looking forward to in the future?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-a-project-within-or-outside-of-jb-that-youre-really-looking-forward-to-in-the-future" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>MovementDAO, and the future of Juicebox v2 are both things that I am working on and that I am looking forward to enabling. We are all learning every day how things work and willing to change it up, but I want to understand some fundamental parts of what makes Juicebox successful not for just raising funds but to getting people to operate treasuries transparently. We (both JB v2 and MovementDAO) want to enable this with endowments, NFT businesses, start-ups, liquidity pools into a well orchestrated decentralized protocol. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-something-people-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you">What’s something people would be surprised to learn about you?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-something-people-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I don’t know, hmm… I lived in a monastery!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="predictions-of-past-and-present"><em>Predictions of Past and Present</em><a class="hash-link" href="#predictions-of-past-and-present" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Once in a while it may be nice to let loose with a little silliness. So enjoy this short article on 18th century critical theory and the folly of technological prophesies.</p><p>Historicism, that nebulous academic term that finds itself increasingly harder to define the more you delve into it, is at play more than you may think in the ever-changing landscape of web3. A term originally coined by Friedrich Schlegel a couple centuries ago, we will define it– for the purposes of this article– simply as the idea that societies at different times in history can oftentimes lose sight of the fact that time keeps marching forward. The future, it turns out, isn’t the easiest thing to predict. And the present doesn’t offer up all the answers. As much as we may be tempted to feel like we’ve got it all figured out, history has a bad habit of revealing the folly that belies this hubris.</p><p>After all, two Romans speaking a couple thousand years ago didn’t ask each other what year it was, only for one to tell the other, “We’re in the year -22 BCE, dummy!”</p><p>All this a long-winded way to say: people tend to lose sight of the future, or, to be more precise, never truly have it. Our ability to predict is pathetically unreliable as systems grow more complex. Case in point: computing power has grown exponentially, and yet we are still terrible at predicting weather. You’d think with all our developments we’d be able to see a massive hurricane before it forms, and yet this feat is presently considered functionally impossible.</p><p>For all the naysayers out there: criticism of new ideas, technologies and ways of building isn’t too new after all. People have a hard time predicting what will work, but hindsight is 20/20. Enjoy as we pit historical figures, living and otherwise, in a match of predictions in the Premonition Rumble!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="jbs-inaugural-premonition-rumble">JB’s Inaugural Premonition Rumble!<a class="hash-link" href="#jbs-inaugural-premonition-rumble" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="warren-buffet-versus-robert-metcalfe">Warren Buffet versus Robert Metcalfe<a class="hash-link" href="#warren-buffet-versus-robert-metcalfe" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>"In terms of cryptocurrencies generally, I can say almost with certainty that they will come to a bad ending.” - Warren Buffet, 2019</p><p><em>vs</em></p><p>“I predict the Internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse.” — Robert Metcalfe, founder of 3Com, inventor of Ethernet, 1995</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="paul-krugman-versus-thomas-edison">Paul Krugman versus Thomas Edison<a class="hash-link" href="#paul-krugman-versus-thomas-edison" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>“Twelve years on, cryptocurrencies play almost no role in normal economic activity.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>“Juicebox in the words of” is a series that highlights JB community members in interview form. Learn about members’ roles at JB and what makes them tick.</em></p><p><em>twodam is a long-term contributor at JB that is known for an incredible work ethic, moderating the discord server, and creating data visualizations. He also serves a unique role in bridging communication between our English and Chinese speaking communities at JB. Read on to learn about his roles as a contributor and communicator for the JB community.</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-did-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-it-changed-since-youve-been-here">How did you get started with JB, and how has it changed since you’ve been here?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-did-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-it-changed-since-youve-been-here" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>When researching ConstitutionDAO, I discovered the platform Juicebox, and joined Discord. During that time I read through the documentation and code base, because I saw a lot of people asking questions, so I spontaneously went to help answer them. It so happened that because of the popularity of ConstitutionDAO, many people joined Discord, and that number of people reached several thousand. Zeugh recognized and recommended me to be the Discord mod. After that I also made several data panels according to the needs, to better show the trends in different aspects of JB. </p><p>Since I’ve joined, JB started to have multi-language support, the governance process got better, the number of contributors increased to a dozen, a lot of things were moving forward, and everyone was smart about it.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thats-awesome-it-sounds-like-youre-a-big-part-of-that-progress-what-would-people-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you-any-interesting-hobbies">That's awesome, it sounds like you're a big part of that progress.

I actually did contract development for a while before and was a full time programmer. I used to study projects from the whole and in detail— for example, studying a protocol from the front-end all the way to the contract implementation, from the documentation to the surrounding tools and from the community to the team atmosphere.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thats-super-cool-when-youre-not-at-a-computer-what-do-you-like-to-do-to-pass-the-time">That's super cool.

I also like to read science fiction and literary fiction.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thats-awesome-a-lot-of-the-web-3-space-can-feel-like-a-sci-fi-to-be-honest">That's awesome.

I also do community support and alignment, and post educational materials for mainly the Chinese community. I’m also actively looking for different things that I could help; recently I’m writing a Juicebox weekly summary with 0xSTVG. Also our website and blog supporting multiple languages is something filip and zotico work on very hard, and I work on the Chinese translations of that.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thats-awesome-and-things-like-the-weekly-summaries-are-really-important-i-always-wonder-about-the-chinese-community-and-how-the-information-travels-between-it-and-the-rest-of-the-community-you-kind-of-bridge-that-gap-from-what-i-understand-is-that-accurate">That's awesome, and things like the weekly summaries are really important. I always wonder about the Chinese community and how the information travels between it and the rest of the community. You kind of bridge that gap from what I understand, is that accurate?<a class="hash-link" href="#thats-awesome-and-things-like-the-weekly-summaries-are-really-important-i-always-wonder-about-the-chinese-community-and-how-the-information-travels-between-it-and-the-rest-of-the-community-you-kind-of-bridge-that-gap-from-what-i-understand-is-that-accurate" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>indeed, with the help of zhape who helped a lot in communication and vibe summaries in town-hall.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thats-amazing-is-it-a-difficult-role-to-have-i-know-sometimes-there-are-differences-of-opinion-between-the-communities-how-do-you-manage-to-keep-the-peace">That's amazing.

Sometimes it’s because people have misunderstandings, I will show them where to check and explain to them the reasoning behind. Sometimes it’s because the language gap, then I will help to translate and/or communicate, for example: find the real problem, let them have discussion and correct the misinterpretations if there were any.</p><p>Yeah, this role is not easy I would say, you can’t make everyone happy... have to balance between a lot of things.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="it-sounds-tough-but-it-also-sounds-like-you-are-taking-a-really-level-headed-and-fair-approach-okay-final-question---what-is-the-favorite-part-of-your-day">It sounds tough, but it also sounds like you are taking a really level-headed and fair approach.

I’d left my other day job early on.</p><p>The first iteration of the JB app was fairly limited; it definitely had some shortcomings, so we figured let’s just get this to a&nbsp; good place and see if people enjoy it. After JB launched it took about a month or so before the project got much traction. After that– I think Sharkdao was the first project that gave it a lot of traction– we got some other front-end contributors to help out with the work that I was doing.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-kept-you-going-early-on-when-you-had-to-move-mountains-and-put-so-much-effort-in-did-you-and-jango-have-a-clear-vision-for-what-all-that-work-was-going-to-amount-to">What kept you going early on, when you had to move mountains and put so much effort in. Did you and jango have a clear vision for what all that work was going to amount to?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-kept-you-going-early-on-when-you-had-to-move-mountains-and-put-so-much-effort-in-did-you-and-jango-have-a-clear-vision-for-what-all-that-work-was-going-to-amount-to" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I think jango and I each had our own unique visions for JB– they weren’t opposed in any ways, but there were definitely certain things that were driving me and important to me, and certain things important to him. Early on– really really early on– I didn’t have a complete vision for how JB would exist in the world; it was more just an interesting experiment to build a web-3 app, and I wanted to get some experience working in web-3. JB is fairly complicated, so over the months we were constantly reshaping it, so the vision was changing as well. About 2-3 months before we launched I started to think about it and realized how valuable it would be to DAOs. While we were building it, DAO’s were only just starting to become big. I felt like, somebody could use this not just as a business or to create a fundraiser, but can create a community of people, and that’s when I felt like JB really came into its own and found itself. The beauty of jb is that it’s super extensive, and can be used for all kind of things, not just DAOs.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-the-average-day-for-you-look-like-now-that-jb-has-kind-of-found-its-stride-and-that-major-early-work-has-been-done">What’s the average day for you look like now that JB has kind of found its stride and that major early work has been done?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-the-average-day-for-you-look-like-now-that-jb-has-kind-of-found-its-stride-and-that-major-early-work-has-been-done" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>It’s definitely changed a bit– in the early days after the launch, once JB went public, it didn’t change a lot, but we were also getting a lot of feedback from people on what was needed and how to better streamline things. Putting a lot of these complex items into a digestible way was very hard, especially when you’re so intimately familiar with these complex processes, so getting feedback from people who were seeing this for the first time was a huge help for us.</p><p>Once there were more full-time contributors coming in (who we formed peel with), it changed a lot. I can’t say enough good things about those early contributors– I feel so blessed that they came so eager and willing to put themselves into the work. From day 1 I was pushing code to fix small bugs and also thinking of these big-picture things, so I had wanted for a while a team to be able to help out with some of that workload. It was really beautiful because it was a time of wondering how to get those people in here, and I wondered: is this what a recruiting process looks like, do I need to be advertising positions, interviewing people and so on? That whole process is not something I was very excited or eager about, so I was just like, “Hopefully there will be people who find the project interesting and show up to help out”– and that ended up being exactly what happened! JohnnyD, Aeolian, Torvusbug, Ooyoo were some of the major early contributors and with them we kicked into high gear. The code base got cleaned up a lot and having that diversity of opinion and diversity of experience was just a huge asset. After a month or so of that we realized we had a real team here, and started feeling like a machine.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="with-growth-happening-so-fast-is-there-any-way-to-even-predict-what-jb-might-look-like-in-a-couple-years">With growth happening so fast, is there any way to even predict what JB might look like in a couple years?<a class="hash-link" href="#with-growth-happening-so-fast-is-there-any-way-to-even-predict-what-jb-might-look-like-in-a-couple-years" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The speed of things is remarkable, and that’s an amazing attribute of web 3. JB feels like it’s going as fast as it can go, and that’s a consequence of a&nbsp; number of things. A big factor is that there’s always public conversations and transparency, so there’s very little time wasted on catching people up, so everyone is getting the info more or less in real-time at the same time. Most people spending time on this aren’t clocking out at 5pm, they’re working when they want to and when they feel like it, and their passion has them executing ideas very quickly, which is wild.</p><p>Talking about 2 years from now, that feels like a lifetime; it’s hard to make any predictions, but I think the main thing we’ll see going forward that I can hardly even really predict– I don’t know what it’ll look like– but I think there’ll be a lot more decentralization of the project itself. With introduction of V2 there’s gonna be a lot of added flexibility, with more diverse use cases people can use JB for, and a lot of these use cases will probably end up being built around custom extensions of JB.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="switching-gears-a-bit-when-you-meet-that-awkward-uncle-at-thanksgiving-we-all-have-and-they-ask-you-what-you-do-how-do-you-explain-jb-and-your-role-in-it">Switching gears a bit: when you meet that awkward uncle at thanksgiving we all have, and they ask you what you do, how do you explain JB and your role in it?<a class="hash-link" href="#switching-gears-a-bit-when-you-meet-that-awkward-uncle-at-thanksgiving-we-all-have-and-they-ask-you-what-you-do-how-do-you-explain-jb-and-your-role-in-it" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Haha. To be honest I don’t find myself in that situation all that often, so I don’t practice very frequently, and every time I do find myself in that situation my take on it may have changed since the last time. Oftentimes, if it’s someone who isn’t familiar with web 3, I won’t even mention JB at all because there’s so many layers of abstraction to go through. But if someone’s really curious, I generally start by comparing it kickstarter, and I don’t really think that’s the best place to start, it’s just the easiest since it’s a fairly similar type of mechanism people are already familiar with. So you can kinda start there as an organization that raises money, but obviously the big differences you have to jump to is issuance of tokens, what that means, the programmability of it all, the restriction on money withdrawal and to whom. That’s when it starts getting really tricky to explain.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="im-always-surprised-by-the-conspicuous-lack-of-assholes-at-jb-where-are-they-all-hiding">I’m always surprised by the conspicuous lack of assholes at JB– where are they all hiding?<a class="hash-link" href="#im-always-surprised-by-the-conspicuous-lack-of-assholes-at-jb-where-are-they-all-hiding" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Haha. I really have never thought about that. There’s a lot of assholes in the world, and maybe there were 2-3 who have come through JB in the past, but I think of it by remembering this term jango said to me once, he used this expression– “DAO immune system”-- and it immediately clicked to me what he meant: every DAO that has a strong culture, they have an immune system, and it’s an immune system to people and decisions. And the consequence of that is if there’s ideas thrown out and talked about that aren’t fitting with the momentum of the DAO, then it tends to be squashed. But the beautiful thing about that is that the way the JB immune system seems to work is very polite and genuine.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="would-you-call-that-killing-with-kindness">Would you call that killing with kindness?<a class="hash-link" href="#would-you-call-that-killing-with-kindness" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Yeah, I definitely see a lot of that, and it’s a beautiful thing. On the topic of the DAO immune system, when factions do emerge, the beautiful thing about it is that it still remains a very democratic process, and evaluations of decisions aren't based on what’s “right” and “wrong”, it’s rather the democratic process of voting with JBX. Also fascinating: they’ve always been fairly close votes when these issues have arisen. Ideally the way the system is set up and the governance processes we have, the DAO will ultimately decide what’s best one way or another, and that’s entirely subjective, since there’s no such thing as an objectively good or bad outcome.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="its-interesting-connecting-daos-to-democracy-in-democracy-we-have-structures-to-influence-voting-like-campaigning-super-pacs-etc-arguably-the-world-of-daos-is-too-young-for-this-but-do-you-see-this-is-an-eventuality-of-communities-and-factions-within-daos-trying-to-gain-control-to-guide-dao-decision-making">It’s interesting connecting DAO’s to democracy– in democracy, we have structures to influence voting, like campaigning, super PACS, etc. Arguably the world of DAOs is too young for this– but do you see this is an eventuality of communities and factions within DAOs trying to gain control to guide DAO decision-making?<a class="hash-link" href="#its-interesting-connecting-daos-to-democracy-in-democracy-we-have-structures-to-influence-voting-like-campaigning-super-pacs-etc-arguably-the-world-of-daos-is-too-young-for-this-but-do-you-see-this-is-an-eventuality-of-communities-and-factions-within-daos-trying-to-gain-control-to-guide-dao-decision-making" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I think we see that already. That’s a necessary part of any voting process, a “campaign”-- it doesn’t necessarily need to look like what we think of campaigns in ordinary politics (posters, pamphlets, etc) but it already does happen, for instance when somebody creates a proposal, there’s an implicit requisite for them to defend that proposal and explain why. The temperature check is designed for discourse, and those types of conversations are themselves a form of campaigning. It’s the responsibility of people much more involved in JB who have a more nuanced understanding of the mechanisms to distill their opinions on responsible voting, or to fairly summarize the pros and cons of the proposal because less-active JB members aren’t as familiar with the proposal.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="excellent-point-switching-gears-who-is-your-favorite-jb-contributor-and-why-is-it-filipv">Excellent point. Switching gears: who is your favorite JB contributor, and why is it filipv?<a class="hash-link" href="#excellent-point-switching-gears-who-is-your-favorite-jb-contributor-and-why-is-it-filipv" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Haha. Filip’s great, I have a lot of love for filip. When I think of filip, the things that come to mind are that he’s just an excellent talker, and being a good talker is not something that feels like a resume item, but it really is, it’s a really truly valuable skill that’s underrated. Having somebody like filip facilitate conversations like he does is super valuable. Not only is he so good at explaining things, he’s also very open-minded, knowledgeable of what he knows and quick not to pretend he’s knowledgeable about what he doesn’t know. He’s very active, and good about proposing things we may not be thinking about. The dude just seems very level-headed; I love talking to him.</p><p>If I had to pick a favorite that wasn’t filipv– I mean you can’t pick just one obviously– but the other person I really respect is aeolian, who has come in and really taken over a lot from me to be the lead front-end person on peel. And I just have so much mad respect for aeolian– not only is he a great developer, but he knows his stuff and is great at writing good code, and he’s great at having conversations about these things and being open to learn, open minded, open to teach. All the times I spent working with him– I really credit a lot of the joy I get contributing to peel, to him and the rest of the peel team, because he’s made work so enjoyable.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thats-awesome-okay-final-question-do-you-have-any-huge-project-in-the-future-youre-particularly-excited-about">That’s awesome. Okay, final question: do you have any huge project in the future you’re particularly excited about?<a class="hash-link" href="#thats-awesome-okay-final-question-do-you-have-any-huge-project-in-the-future-youre-particularly-excited-about" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>That’s hard to say. At the moment, as of about a week ago, I’m spending much less time at JB. I’ve contributed to JB for so long, and having a solid group of contributors like the peel team to help take on my workload has eased me up to pursue new projects. I’ve wanted to do some different type of work that is’t necessarily front-end code, like some solidity work, and art-projects, and so on. So I do have a lot more time to spend on other projects now, and there’s another project that I’m working on now– that hasn’t really been announced yet– but I’m looking forward to announcing it soon.</p><p>(Note: this interview was transcribed from a discord call.)</p>]]></content>

Read on to learn a bit about JB’s beginnings and the vision that spawned it.</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-it-changed-since-youve-been-here">How'd you get started with JB, and how has it changed since you've been here?<a class="hash-link" href="#howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-it-changed-since-youve-been-here" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>It started as a seed of thought. Around 2014/2015ish, I was building this app in iOS dev world. That was back in my younger days when I loved building shit, working with friends, piecing together who’s good at what, etc. We didn’t have a tonne of users on the app, but we had an open slack server where several users would come hang out with the builders</p><p>We didn’t want to think about price, business models, advertising etc. We just wanted to build, and we didn’t like thinking of this structure with users on one side to pay fees, and builders on the other to create and get paid, since we felt like the folks using the app were a part of the building process as well.</p><p>One day I was sitting with my notebook, trying to figure out how this whole thing was going to play out, and I captured an idea floating by. If we figured out exactly how much it would cost to run this thing, including server hosting, salaries, and so on, we could come up with one number we needed to get to by the end of the month. When we realized we could enumerate exactly what those expenses were to the users, fully transparently, and tell them listen, this is what we need to get to each month for the service to run, and if we exceed this number, we’re going to use that overflow to push down the price of the product– once we realized that, we just ran with the idea and that became the product. It seems like a win-win– the team gets paid, the users get a service, and if it becomes more successful, the service becomes more and more affordable, or even free.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="that-sounds-like-a-light-bulb-moment-how-did-it-translate-into-your-project-at-that-time">That sounds like a light-bulb moment. How did it translate into your project at that time?<a class="hash-link" href="#that-sounds-like-a-light-bulb-moment-how-did-it-translate-into-your-project-at-that-time" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>So I stopped the project to focus full time on the building out this new concept, but tried to do it all in the Web 2 world, and it was really really hard– trying to forge relationships with banking systems about a system where there’s fees, maybe fee refunds if we have overflow, etc., and someone would have coordinate all these fees, refunds, and so on, it just wasn’t possible to manage all that with Web 2 structures. Around that same time I was delving into crypto, learning about the blockchain, smart contracts, and then in hit me: this idea was executable, but we were totally swimming against the current trying to do it in the Web 2 space. So I hunkered down and jumped into learning everything I could about smart contracts, did some prototypes, and by that time a lot of the team was like man, I can’t get dragged on another project, so I decided to kind of jump in head-first and take the lead on seeing how this would play out. I figured the moment we had something tangible, all these brilliant people who I’d met and who I had the luxury to spend time with would just hop on and help give it life.</p><p>At this point I was working hard along with peri to get this concept built out, and we actually went a few different iterations of the name. There was “the sustainers market”, back in the Web 2 world, and then eventually we called it “fountain”, because of how overflow from payments kind of would trickle down, and then at a certain point, I think it was peri who said, let’s just call it “milk”, and we got real funky with it and said fine, and so it was “milk” for about five minutes, and then we decided on “juice,” and that actually stuck for a while. It wasn’t until like a week before launch that we felt like man, something’s missing, and then somehow we came up with “Juicebox,” and we all felt immediately like yes, that’s the one, and so we launched with that.</p><p>In terms of where JB is today: everyday it changes a little bit, and early on we had no idea how it would be used. I had a decent understanding of how I may use it, but seeing how it’s been used has been really awesome. But who the hell knows where it’s going. We learned so much along the way, and a lot of incredible badass motherfuckers started to come through and add on to it, and it’s only gotten better and better because of that.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="peri-told-me-about-the-dao-immune-system---a-term-you-coined---can-you-explain-it-in-a-bit-more-detail">peri told me about the “DAO immune system” - a term you coined - can you explain it in a bit more detail?<a class="hash-link" href="#peri-told-me-about-the-dao-immune-system---a-term-you-coined---can-you-explain-it-in-a-bit-more-detail" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I remember that! That’s a fascinating concept. People are diverse, and JB has always had an amazing team, but over the span since launch there have been some ideas that have come up and vouched for adoption or funding, or were communicated in non-productive ways, and other folks started running away from these or critiquing them heavily, the same way a body would reject a pathogen. I found that so fascinating, and wondered how that worked, since it seemed to happen all on its own.</p><p>The DAO is interesting, in that I see it more as a place where ideas exist and sometimes compete. I don’t think people are bad for DAOs, but ideas can certainly take root and harm the operation of a DAO. The interesting thing is early on in a DAO, ideas that come up for vote are not only important short-term, but also precedent-setting. This is a double-edged sword though, because while setting precedent can kind of immunize a DAO against future bad ideas, it can also lead a DAO to try to solve new problems with old methods. All of this is still in a nascent stage, and very fragile, so it’s interesting to see how it plays out, but I do think a DAO has some built-in mechanisms, certainly JB does, that kind of helps it move in positive, productive directions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="speaking-of-how-fragile-all-this-is-how-do-you-approach-managing-risk">Speaking of how fragile all this is, how do you approach managing risk?<a class="hash-link" href="#speaking-of-how-fragile-all-this-is-how-do-you-approach-managing-risk" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A lot of the things I learned come from taking risk, and I’m not a risk averse person. In this context specifically, maybe as a programmer of the contracts you tend to feel a bit more of that weight, and you can sense a community in anticipation, and a zealousness, and so just peeling toward balance in general I think is healthy. More generally, and this is something I constantly point out, is that we need to keep the focus– it’s tempting to go to the next thing prematurely– but we need to keep the focus and stay the course on the tasks in the here and now.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="jb-seems-so-inclusive-and-friendly-so-im-wondering-where-are-all-the-assholes">JB seems so inclusive and friendly, so I’m wondering: where are all the assholes?<a class="hash-link" href="#jb-seems-so-inclusive-and-friendly-so-im-wondering-where-are-all-the-assholes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I’m kind of a proponent of assholery, if it’s needed. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-wait-jb-doesnt-need-it-now-did-it-ever">So wait, JB doesn’t need it now? Did it ever?<a class="hash-link" href="#so-wait-jb-doesnt-need-it-now-did-it-ever" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>At JB, we’re doing a thing and everyone has a mode of operation– when you talk about inclusivity, it’s not saying that anything goes. After all a lot of people are taking a lot of risk here, and we can’t be inclusive of things like cutting corners or taking simple approaches that don’t match the complexity of a problem. I don’t think being an asshole is good, obviously, but sometimes you do need to focus in the conversation, and there will always be some people who don’t want to do that, but I think that’s where the limit is to the inclusivity. So I don’t think there’s assholes around, but if we needed them to keep us honest, or if a situation requires people to act that way to make real progress, then maybe we’d see more of them. Fortunately at JB we’re a good team and we communicate well, the transparency is there, but if that wasn’t the case then I don’t know that assholes would be a bad thing.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="who-is-your-favorite-jb-contributor-and-why-is-it-zeugh">Who is your favorite JB contributor, and why is it Zeugh?<a class="hash-link" href="#who-is-your-favorite-jb-contributor-and-why-is-it-zeugh" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Zeugh is a complex, charming character. I’m a sucker for really complex, charming characters. I don’t care for yea-sayers or nay-sayers, and people like Zeugh are their own person. Love him for it.</p><p>Without question peri is my favorite for many reasons, Zeugh for many reasons, Mieos for many reasons. Twodam is a fucking legend, he’s subtle and sometimes goes unnoticed but holy moly, anytime I talk to anyone about some of our contributors twodam comes up and oh my goodness, what an incredible incredible person.
Not a fair question.</p><p>Folks who have a strong belief or mindset or some part about them that isn’t looking to step aside (or who just want to be there by association), but rather people who want to be there because of who they are, that tends to be the ones that stick out to me. People who, given a good enough idea, argument or situation, will 100% get behind something and contribute to its success, even if they at first have a hard time with it, are the kinds of people that stick out to me. It’s not stubbornness per se; it’s productive arguments and debates and vibes and fun.</p><p>Oh man… It’s impossible to pick a favorite, but that characteristic of people is definitely important to me.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="excellent-answer-okay-final-question-whats-something-people-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you">Excellent answer. Okay, final question! What’s something people would be surprised to learn about you?<a class="hash-link" href="#excellent-answer-okay-final-question-whats-something-people-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I’m not a very fun or interesting person, really. Nothing to see here, move along.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>“Juicebox in the words of” is a series that highlights JB community members in interview form.

That’s led to a few things– one is that the culture has evolved, it’s gotten a bit more serious and formal, but we’ve also had a really large demographic shift as the Chinese community has taken greater interest in JB. The team has grown, and I feel like we’ve moved into a higher gear work-wise, and become more efficient as a team.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-would-you-describe-your-role-at-jb">How would you describe your role at JB?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-would-you-describe-your-role-at-jb" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>If I had to put a title, I guess “operations”, or “operations generalist”. I have varying amounts of skill in a number of places, and I try my best to chip in where I can, but that also means I’m pretty diverse in what I do; I tend to be shifting more toward governance stuff/writing proposals, but generally I just look at what JB is doing, and I try to help steer the ship in a direction that is fitting.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="in-my-experience-at-jb-so-far-everyones-been-very-nice-and-helpful-so-im-wondering-where-are-all-the-assholes">In my experience at JB so far, everyone’s been very nice and helpful, so I’m wondering: where are all the assholes?<a class="hash-link" href="#in-my-experience-at-jb-so-far-everyones-been-very-nice-and-helpful-so-im-wondering-where-are-all-the-assholes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I would say a lot of times people become assholes in a corporate setting due to resentment that stems from a lack of honesty or allowing expression, but JB is quite good at facilitating expression. Also I think JB attracts a different type of person– there’s no job interview, manager telling you what to do, etc.-- you really have to be a self-starter, and since everything is handled by voting by your peers, there’s real incentives for you to get along; if you’re an asshole, people will vote you out.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-something-that-people-would-be-surprised-to-find-out-about-you">What’s something that people would be surprised to find out about you?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-something-that-people-would-be-surprised-to-find-out-about-you" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Hmm.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>We’re kicking off a new blog series, “Juicebox in the Words of”, where a community member gets interviewed about their experience contributing to JB. Take this series as a chance to learn about community members, and to get a little glimpse of things you may not have known before.</em></p><p><em>Zom_Bae is an absolute delight in the JB community— humble and always ready to assist a community member in need of help. She co-hosts the JB podcast and has an excellent sense of humor. Within the discord she tirelessly connects people and ties up loose ends that many of us don’t even notice are there. Read on for a glimpse into Zom_Bae’s role at JB and personality as one of our very amazing community members!</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-it-changed-since-youve-been-here">How'd you get started with JB, and how has it changed since you've been here?<a class="hash-link" href="#howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-it-changed-since-youve-been-here" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Oh wow...great question!
I initially started quietly lurking in JB honestly because I know and admire the team who created it.  I have zero technical background so as you can probably imagine...I had no clue what any of them were talking about.  I can't remember exactly when I joined, but probably around October '21.  The discord was still pretty small, I think we there were max 5-6 people on town hall calls so it was very close knit but very welcoming to normies like myself (which to be honest, it's still a pretty tight group of contributors who are also still very welcoming imo even though the membership has grown quite a lot)!  I started slowly but surely participating, asking questions (even "dumb" ones),  then ultimately took on a pm role to help keep people moving in a forward direction and tasks from slipping through cracks.  Since I joined, JB has definitely matured.  Processes have been dialed in, incredible work teams have come together, grown and transitioned into their own DOAs  (amazing!), and the synergy in how, so many people, from all over the world is nothing less than awe inspiring! </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="that-is-some-awesome-background-really-interesting-stuff-it-sounds-like-you-have-a-pretty-wide-perspective-having-been-here-so-long-compared-to-many-so-for-your-role-here-how-would-you-call-yourself-it-sounds-like-youre-kind-of-a-fixer-somebody-who-comes-and-makes-things-run-smoothly-patches-up-cracks-that-arise-etc">That is some awesome background, really interesting stuff. It sounds like you have a pretty wide perspective, having been here so long compared to many. So for your role here, how would you call yourself? It sounds like you're kind of a fixer, somebody who comes and makes things run smoothly, patches up cracks that arise, etc.<a class="hash-link" href="#that-is-some-awesome-background-really-interesting-stuff-it-sounds-like-you-have-a-pretty-wide-perspective-having-been-here-so-long-compared-to-many-so-for-your-role-here-how-would-you-call-yourself-it-sounds-like-youre-kind-of-a-fixer-somebody-who-comes-and-makes-things-run-smoothly-patches-up-cracks-that-arise-etc" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>So, I like that observation- but certainly not a fixer technically speaking-I guess more along the lines if something isn't getting done, I give soft nudges for reminders.  I also like to think I'm a connector.  If new folks come in, looking for something in particular, whether an answer to a protocol question or how to get started with picking up tasks, I do a decent job pointing them in the right direction, then following up when necessary.  I'm like one of those old phone operators...just connecting dots! </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="between-you-and-me-and-the-rest-of-the-internet-who-is-your-favorite-contributor-and-why-is-it-jango">Between you and me and the rest of the internet, who is your favorite contributor, and why is it jango?<a class="hash-link" href="#between-you-and-me-and-the-rest-of-the-internet-who-is-your-favorite-contributor-and-why-is-it-jango" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>favorite contributor...hard question. I'm going with the pc answer here: they're all freaking rad humans! There's no way I can pick just one. Nice try though (although pay close attention to Dr. Gorilla- he's got some jokes)!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thats-a-fair-and-diplomatic-response-i-expected-nothing-less-ill-notate-that-dr-gorilla-is-your-favorite">That's a fair and diplomatic response, I expected nothing less. I'll notate that Dr. Gorilla is your favorite.<a class="hash-link" href="#thats-a-fair-and-diplomatic-response-i-expected-nothing-less-ill-notate-that-dr-gorilla-is-your-favorite" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>lol he's <em>one of</em> my favs. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="are-there-any-projects-on-jb-that-youve-been-really-stoked-about-or-what-would-you-say-is-a-moment-of-great-excitement-youve-experienced-at-jb">Are there any projects on JB that you've been really stoked about, or what would you say is a moment of great excitement you've experienced at JB?<a class="hash-link" href="#are-there-any-projects-on-jb-that-youve-been-really-stoked-about-or-what-would-you-say-is-a-moment-of-great-excitement-youve-experienced-at-jb" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I think Movement Dao is something to keep an eye on. It feels special in a way that none of the other projects to date have.  They're really trying to find ways to create "movements" to make the world a better place without it feeling hokey or like a canned answer in a beauty pageant (are they even called that anymore- don't get me cancelled!).  One thing I heard in a recent town hall was "community can solve our biggest problems" and that stuck with me!  IMO, they're doin' it right! go check 'em out! </p><p>As far as a moment of great excitement at JB would have to include when constitution DAO popped off...that. was. wild.   I believe it was around Thanksgiving- I went to bed knowing one, peaceful, calm version up JB and woke up to a whirlwind of new members, wen moon, and tons of questions!  Zeugh and Nicolas took the brunt of that, definitely get their versions-great stories- but man, it was intense!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sounds-intense-ive-been-taken-aback-at-how-approachable-and-nice-and-inclusive-people-have-been-here-at-jb-so-im-wondering-where-are-all-the-assholes">Sounds intense! I’ve been taken aback at how approachable and nice and inclusive people have been here at JB, so I’m wondering, where are all the assholes?<a class="hash-link" href="#sounds-intense-ive-been-taken-aback-at-how-approachable-and-nice-and-inclusive-people-have-been-here-at-jb-so-im-wondering-where-are-all-the-assholes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>lololol...JB is a "No Asshole Zone"</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="haha-thats-what-everyones-been-telling-me-what-is-something-about-you-that-would-surprise-other-jb-members-to-learn">Haha, that’s what everyone’s been telling me.

Last question!— it’s the future, and you can make your ideal web space, whether that’s a DAO or any online space at all— what do you think you’ll make?<a class="hash-link" href="#yes-to-coaching-although-running-into-trees-could-be-a-problem-for-both-wellness-and-mountain-biking-and-plant-care-last-question-its-the-future-and-you-can-make-your-ideal-web-space-whether-thats-a-dao-or-any-online-space-at-all-what-do-you-think-youll-make" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>oooo, good question.  I'm actually trying to answer that for myself.  I want to figure out a way to gamify wellness that's enjoyable and doesn't feel like a task. Wellbeing is so so crucial but is so easily ignored because most people just don't know what they don't know (ie: don't realized they can feel better physically and mentally). What that looks like exactly...stay tuned.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Cryptovoxels environment from above]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image-fae86f5a3ab9bc0e2bbadd3e7bf1b988.png" width="1012" height="786" class="img_ev3q">The Cryptovoxels environment from above</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-new-way-to-wind-down">A new way to wind down<a class="hash-link" href="#a-new-way-to-wind-down" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The DAO space online isn’t like your average experience working at a company or corporation. Unlike the physical environment of offices, cubicles, and maybe the occasional beanbag chair if you happen to work at one of those <em>fun</em> places, the online space where DAOs operate is free from constraints and incentives. It’s a space where people create for the sake of it, and pool effort together as a means of expression. Don’t get me wrong, there are plenty of endeavors out there that seek to make money, but the crucial difference is about what we call the bottom line, and what it looks like in a DAO space versus traditional settings.</p><p>Enter Cryptovoxels: an online space where participants can congregate, listen to music together, and even enjoy a “live” show in a virtual environment (pictured above). The Cryptovoxels space isn’t unique for what it is— plenty of paid spaces exist that try to achieve the same goal. The reason Cryptovoxels is unique is precisely for what it isn’t. It’s not about raising money, or pandering to users for shares and likes and what have you. It’s a space to wind down and enjoy together in a uniquely anti-consumerist experience. A space where creatives, programmers, technical writers, holders and any and all between can congregate for the sake of it.
<img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image-1-6e3eae77df934fd727c2e144665c75f2.png" width="1012" height="786" class="img_ev3q">A lounge in the Cryptovoxels space</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="creating-for-the-sake-of-it">Creating for the sake of it<a class="hash-link" href="#creating-for-the-sake-of-it" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Spaces like Cryptovoxels are unique because of how they come about. In a traditional work environment or major corporation, somebody at the top may have an idea to create a space such as Cryptovoxels. From there, the idea would distill as it trickled down the workforce, ultimately culminating in strict directives and program managers. In other words, the project would itself become work— anathema to its very purpose!</p><p>In the DAOsphere, the whole process is put on its head. Eager community members, excited to contribute to a greater organization, and at times simply wanting to spin their wheels, generate projects such as Cryptovoxels not in order to make money, not in order to boast, not in order to monetize an experience, but, rather, simply to enjoy a moment— a happening, a vibe— with one another in a shared space. Where else can we say that this is the case?
<img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image-2-e7f94e82fe56a886b9039a6f72767937.png" width="1012" height="786" class="img_ev3q">A Cryptovoxel room, replete with revolving door and anonymous puppet avatar)</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="web-30-is-a-state-of-mind">Web 3.0 is a state of mind<a class="hash-link" href="#web-30-is-a-state-of-mind" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The spaces engendered by an overall feeling toward collaboration, decentralization and egalitarian work-force options are encapsulated by Cryptovoxels. They’re spaces that uniquely represent a way of thinking about the world and its members differently than before. They represent an open view of the world that seeks to collaborate into greater and greater projects without, importantly, treating everything in accordance with it’s bottom-line monetary value.</p><p>The era of web 3.0 is ushering in a way of thinking inclusively and openly about collaboration unlike anything we’ve seen before. The irony that the same Web 3.0 that brought us NFTs of just about everything can also bring us closer together in a completely non-exploitative way is rich, to be sure. But seeing this irony as a beauty, rather than a contradiction, is probably a better representation of the spirit of our times.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tips for Starting a Successful Juicebox Project]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tips-for-starting-a-successful-juicebox-project">Tips for Starting a Successful Juicebox Project<a class="hash-link" href="#tips-for-starting-a-successful-juicebox-project" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Before starting a project on Juicebox, take some time to consider how you’re going to incentivize contributions. Juicebox has become a platform to support a thriving ecosystem of DAOs, who are all at different points in their development. It can be tough to stand out through the noise and develop a key marketing strategy for your project or DAO. Starting a successful web3 project is hard work with most projects on JuiceBox failing to attract more than 1 ETH in contributions.</p><p>Here are 3 tips for giving investors confidence and encouraging ETH contributions for you DAO, that I’ve learned from my time assisting at SharkDao.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="have-reputable-signers-for-the-multisig-and-a-plan-for-how-those-funds-are-released">Have reputable signers for the multisig and a plan for how those funds are released.<a class="hash-link" href="#have-reputable-signers-for-the-multisig-and-a-plan-for-how-those-funds-are-released" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>One of the first questions I ask when analyzing DAOs is “how are the funds secured?” If you’ve been paying attention to DeFi news recently you’ll have heard of the Wonderland fiasco, where one member with a shady history was allowed to manage the treasury of the DAO. This has not bode well for $TIME price action and the Wonderland community. Having reputable signers to properly store and distribute finds is crucial to the success of a DAO, no matter how big the treasury is.</p><p>The most common way to secure funds is to have multiple signers on Gnosis safe (more info here) to ensure that not any single person can rug the project. Many DAOs I’ve seen get past the first step of having a gnosis safe in the first place instead of just one wallet, but then fail the second part of security which is having reputable signers.</p><p>Having singers that check off at least some of these boxes can be a big confidence boost for potential members looking to invest into your project.</p><ol><li>A signer with an established presence on twitter</li><li>A signer involved in multiple projects throughout the crypto space</li><li>A signer who is doxxed and is reputable outside of the metaverse</li><li>A member of the Juicebox team</li><li>A member of a different prominent DAO or multisig signer.</li><li>A paid reputable neutral party to assist with signing (crypto funds, institutions, etc.)</li></ol><p>Ask around on discord and twitter, and you may be pleasantly surprised by the generosity of the web3 community to assist in your DAO, and maybe even make a friend or two.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="have-a-tokenomics-and-governance-strategy">Have a tokenomics and governance strategy<a class="hash-link" href="#have-a-tokenomics-and-governance-strategy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>If people are going to be contributing to your project, it helps to let potential new members know what exactly they are buying into. Slush funds, for vague and unspecified purposes are a red flag for potential rug pulls or honeypots on Juicebox.</p><p>Before starting a project on Juicebox, it’s best to clarify to potential new members: what is the purpose of your projects coin?</p><p>When someone contributes to your project, what does the token they get in return represent? Natively, Juicebox allows projects to enable token holders make a claim on a projects treasury, but beyond that token utility is only bound by social or legal agreements.</p><p>Some ideas to add utility:</p><ol><li>Governance rights. Each token represents a single vote in off chain voting tools like Snapshot.</li><li>Token gating. Requiring either one or multiple tokens to enter select or all discord sever channels.</li><li>Claim on treasury. Juicebox allows projects to let token holders make a claim on a projects treasury, and burn coins for eth.</li><li>Mint pass. Holding tokens allows you an ability to mint free or paid NFTs.</li></ol><p>Experiment, stand out, think of new and novel ideas for both your governance and tokenomics, and you’ll be far more likely to and attract attention to your project.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="have-a-friendly-and-inviting-discord-fun-and-exciting-twitter-and-a-thorough-faq-that-is-updated-regularly">Have a friendly and inviting discord, fun and exciting twitter, and a thorough FAQ that is updated regularly.<a class="hash-link" href="#have-a-friendly-and-inviting-discord-fun-and-exciting-twitter-and-a-thorough-faq-that-is-updated-regularly" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The first two touch points people are likely to have with your project are going to be your Twitter and Discord. Twitter and Discord have become the two go-to platforms for web3 communities, and are a tried and true recipe for success. Most web3 projects don’t ever launch to platforms like Instagram and Tiktok and still remain highly competitive. While other social media platforms may be helpful for your project, it’s best to stick to only twitter and discord, especially if you’re stretched for time and talent. If you market your twitter+discord well, it is far more effective than half a dozen social media platforms marketed mediocrely.</p><p>Successful web3 projects are able to leverage their twitter to attract high quality community members, who often become key contributors. Potential members will find your discord and evaluate the strength of your project, often based on aesthetic values at a first glance. Here’s a checklist to help you make sure your socials are well maintained</p><p>Twitter:</p><ol><li>Push twitter updates regularly. Daily is best, but at a bare minimum twice a week, or your project will start to appear absent and unmanaged.</li><li>Reply and engage with other twitter accounts, don’t only push status updates.</li><li>Have an engaging pinned tweet, and aesthetically pleasing profile picture+banner. First impressions are important.</li><li>Offer giveaways and contests to encourage engagement (don’t overdo it!).</li></ol><p>When starting a discord, it’s important that there’s someone to greet new members, be friendly, and answer questions. This person of contact is often called a community manager (CM). In larger projects, there’s often a dedicated CM to do this job, but in smaller projects this job usually falls to someone on the founding team. Regardless of who is assigned to these tasks, it’s important that there always be someone answering questions and directing people to proper resources in a reasonable amount of time. &nbsp;Here are some tips to make a community managing less stressful, and more engaging for members.</p><p>Discord:</p><ol><li>Keep channels to a minimum when possible.</li><li>Clear and concise channel names and descriptions.</li><li>Create an FAQ + resource guide and update it regularly. If a question is asked twice, it’s a frequently asked question. Chances are it will be asked a third time.</li><li>Offer a fun and engaging role system for your discord. Some ideas: react roles where people can self assign, being helpful gets its own role, donators/investors get their own role.</li><li>Same as twitter, offer giveaways and contests to encourage engagement (again, don’t overdo it!)</li></ol><p>Put time, love, and energy into your socials and you’ll attract both capital and talent to your project.</p><p>-Synth</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Becoming a contributor at JB wasn't exactly intentional. &nbsp;It wasn't until a conversation with a community member that I was able to articulate and realize that getting paid was more than just a possibility. I had first learned about DAOs a few years ago but never really understood what they did or how they got things done. &nbsp;How do DAOs coordinate? How do they align their philosophy? &nbsp;How did they keep each other accountable? &nbsp;All of these questions were very difficult for me to wrap my head around. I then stumbled upon JB after finding out about the NOUNS project and then finding SharkDao which was using Juicebox for its treasury.</p><p>What I talked about with this JB community member was the fact that I didn't say a word in Juicebox for 2 - 3 weeks. &nbsp;I attended a couple of town hall meetings and listened in on some voice chats that were happening, not knowing what the agenda was or what they were going to be talking about. &nbsp;I remember reading a bunch of &nbsp;threads in Discord, trying to follow one or two specific issues, to see how the community tried to solve them. &nbsp;What became clear was that it was important for me to not try to understand what a few people were doing, but to try and understand what the community was doing. &nbsp;That was an epiphany for me. &nbsp;It made me ask, "where do this community's values and my personal beliefs and ethics intersect?"</p><p>This was the moment I started to look for tasks that helped me align myself with the community philosophy. &nbsp;I started to shift my mindset from a quiet observer to thinking about how I could provide value that &nbsp;could help advance the protocol and in turn, the Juicebox Community. &nbsp;As I was exploring, I realized that I was also learning how to navigate the community. &nbsp;How to navigate the notion, the web site, the Discord and everything else that might go along with JB.</p><p>To those wanting to become Juicebox contributors: follow a couple of tasks or issues and see how those issues are being solved by the community. &nbsp;Then see if those solutions line up with how you might handle those issues. <strong>That doesn't mean you have to agree.</strong> &nbsp;It just means that how we talk to each other and how we interact with each other lines up with how you want to talk to people and how you want to be talked to.</p><p>If you start this way, not only will you find a way to contribute but you will see that the Juicebox community will help you contribute. &nbsp;You'll see that Juicebox will view you not just as someone that has a valuable skill but someone that has a philosophy that aligns with the goals of the Juicebox community.</p>]]></content>

This rate currently decreases by 10% every other week. There is a proposal to push this up to 20%.</p><p>At the current redemption bonding curve of 60%, the protocol is offering 1 ETH back from the treasury for each <strong>679,652 JBX </strong>burned. There is a proposal to change this rate to 95%, at which the protocol would be offering 1 ETH for about <strong>459,219 JBX</strong> burned.</p><p>The price of JBX / ETH on Uniswap is currently <strong>446,380 JBX</strong> per 1 ETH traded.</p><p>JuiceboxDAO currently has a reserved rate of 35%, which means 112,495 new JBX get reserved per ETH contributed to the treasury alongside the amount issued for the contributor. 30% of this goes to the DAO (dao.jbx.eth), 24% to jango.eth, 24% to peri.eth, 7% to nnnnicholas.eth, 7% to exekias.eth, 4% to CanuDAO, and 4% to WAGMI Studios. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="observations">Observations<a class="hash-link" href="#observations" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>JBX is currently trading in between the issuance and the burn rates on off-protocol markets such as the Uniswap AMM. There's currently no incentive for anyone to inflate or shrink the JBX supply.</li></ul><p>The protocol says nothing about what might happen off-protocol. The following are just my assumptions and not financial advice. &nbsp;</p><ul><li>If the market price of JBX increases past the protocol's issuance price, any additional demand of JBX can be fulfilled by contributing ETH to the Juicebox treasury which will in turn mint and distribute JBX.</li></ul><p>Risk taking arbitragers might be incentivized to mint extra JBX at this funding cycle's rate to cover the 10% spread that will become available when the cycle rolls over and the discount takes effect. They can also benefit from information asymmetry by minting JBX to fill buy orders on off-protocol markets – <em>the JuiceboxDAO community should work to minimize the opportunity for information asymmetry</em>.</p><p>Either of these will benefit all JBX holders who have held their JBX from better rates during previous funding cycles – their share of the total JBX in circulation will shrink, but the ETH treasury that backs each JBX will grow at a faster rate, which has the effect of increasing the burn rate.</p><ul><li>If the price of JBX decreases past the protocol's burn rate, further demand to sell JBX can be fulfilled by burning JBX to get ETH that is locked in the treasury's overflow.</li></ul><p>Again, arbitragers can benefit from information asymmetry by burning JBX to fill sell orders on off-protocol markets – <em>again, the JuiceboxDAO community should work to minimize the opportunity for information asymmetry. </em></p><p>Either of these will benefit all JBX holders who chose to hold their JBX through the sell pressure – every JBX that is redeemed at a redemption bonding curve leaves some ETH on the table from its proportional share (60% curve leaves a lot more on the table for holders than a 95% curve, exaggerating the effect). In all cases except a 100% redemption curve, the JBX circulating supply will be decreasing at a faster rate than the treasury's ETH supply. This will marginally increase the burn rate for JBX with each subsequent burn, which will add upward pressure on prices, shrink supply, and leave only the holders that turned away the potentially mounting exit incentive to keep building. </p><ul><li>Over time as the market pushes against the issue and burn rates, a JBX holder's burn rate will increase and might eventually exceed the value that the JBX was minted at. </li></ul><p>The more pressure on either side, the more the burn rate increases for each holder. On the other hand, the burn rate will stay the same if the market is being satisfied off protocol.</p><p>Tail market events benefit JBX holders most, albeit in a contained and measured way. The only thing that does not benefit JBX holders is the lack of change in JBX demand over time. Under this mechanism, it seems we are sacrificing price swings for resiliency.</p><ul><li>The DAO is spending ETH each funding cycle to pay out contributors, services, and grants as proposals get approved by JBX holders. The impact of this spending is spread across all JBX holders, marginally reducing everyone's burn rate. </li></ul><p>The DAO could also allocate ETH off-platform in its multisig wallet or various other contracts across web3. This value is currently impossible to account for in the burn rate given the current version of the Juicebox protocol.</p><ul><li><p>The reserved token list only captures value when the token supply is growing. Once token supply has expanded and the market is satisfied off protocol, reserved token holders are massively incentivized to push the price up towards its limit. </p></li><li><p>It is expensive to mint 51% of all tokens in existence, even without a reserved rate. If this were to happen, the ETH used to mint the token majority would immediately fund an increased burn rate for every token holder from previous cycles. The new influential JBX holder would have to appease a community with potentially significant exit incentive.</p></li></ul><p>This same effect exists if the 51% is bought all-of-the-sudden by thousands of uncoordinated people on the internet.</p><ul><li>The DAO (dao.jbx.eth) currently receives 30% of reserved JBX tokens. The DAO is considering committing a percent of this built up supply to circulate among contributors via the DAO's discord. </li></ul><p>It can do so in many ways, one approach is to split the allocation among the addresses on the reserved list, who are then encouraged to split this initial supply entirely between those who they work closest with and who's contributions they want to recognize. Those recipients are in turn encouraged to continue circulating this supply. </p><p>The goal is to make sure everyone who is building and maintaining the protocol and ecosystem becomes significant JBX token holders that can formally help the DAO make decisions.</p><p>If this internal JBX distribution system increases the governance participation of new builders and of those who steward the protocol, then the DAO may benefit from expanding this program by increasing the portion of reserved tokens allocated to the DAO treasury, and reducing the reserved token allocation to other recipients.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Entering the world of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) is kind of like opening the gates to Narnia: it's thrilling, it's confusing, and because real money is involved, it's somewhat scary.</p><p>Late 2021 appears to be the frontier of DAOs, and best practices and playbooks for starting and governing DAOs are being written as I write this.</p><p>In particular, the DAO stack - the set of software tools required to run a DAO - is beginning to mature. One such example is Juicebox - a DAO treasury protocol - which was recently picked by the <a href="https://juicebox.money/#/p/constitutiondao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ConstitutionDAO</a> to raise almost ~47million USD in an attempt to buy a copy of the United States Constitution.</p><p>In this article, we'll define the fundamental functions of a DAO and describe the tools required to fulfill these functions. The content is a derivative of Juicebox contributor <code>@nnnnicholas</code> 's episode on The Fintech Blueprint Podcast; if audio is your thing, <a href="https://twitter.com/nnnnicholas/status/1460661895879348232?s=20&amp;t=uUoFXuazXWYqRUgHLflMfQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check it out</a>!
<img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/c3kCNED-0e33cfdedeab369a29b964b8ff3067b4.png" width="1320" height="1110" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-a-dao-do"><strong>What's a DAO do?</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#whats-a-dao-do" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>At present, a DAO is more of a concept rather than a strict organizational definition. We'll talk about DAOs as they are being used today in the crypto/NFT world. In this world, a DAO has 2 main functions:</p><ol><li>Building a treasury of assets (NFTs, Ethereum (ETH), or some other token)</li><li>Governing the treasury</li></ol><p>Let's say your favorite podcaster decides to set up a DAO for their podcast. They need assets (read: money) to keep the podcast going and do bigger and better things like merch and in-person events. So, they need a way to build a treasury of assets. They'll issue an ERC20 token (let's call this token <code>$PODC</code>), and anyone who contributes funds to the treasury will receive <code>$PODC</code> token in exchange. You, the listener, believe in this podcaster and want to be a part of their success. So you buy some <code>$PODC</code> token and contribute to the treasury.</p><p>As a <code>$PODC</code> token holder, you have perks. You can propose changes to the podcast format and make guest proposals, and you can also vote on other proposals. You and the other token holders now have skin in the game - or skin in the podcast - and have a meaningful impact on the podcast and its success. The DAO can be creative here, too. Holding a token might grant you access to a private discord, private meetings, or airdrops. In a successful DAO, the DAO may vote to distribute excess funds to token holders.</p><p>Don't like what the DAO is doing? No worries! Your tokens are 100% backed by the treasury, meaning you can sell your token back to the DAO and receive your original investment (less gas and other fees).</p><p>An attractive characteristic of a DAO when compared to a traditional private company is transparency. Every aspect of the DAO is available on and verified by, the blockchain. Any eager individual can observe the flow of assets and call out dodgy activity. Importantly, no accountants or lawyers are required!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-dao-stack"><strong>The DAO stack</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#the-dao-stack" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>To achieve the 2 functions of a DAO, we're going to need some tools. Luckily, smart folks are putting in the leg work and the DAO stack is maturing rapidly. Below, we'll discuss Juicebox, Gnosis, Snapshot, and Aragon - 4 key tools in the DAO stack - and how they fit together to form a DAO.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="juicebox"><strong>Juicebox</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#juicebox" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The <a href="https://juicebox.money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicebox</a> protocol is a programmable treasury. In practice, you can think of Juicebox as a decentralized alternative to Kickstarter; a way to raise funds on the blockchain. It fulfills the first function of the DAO: building the treasury. Technically speaking, Juicebox is a <a href="https://github.com/jbx-protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">set of smart contracts</a> deployed on the Ethereum blockchain that handles the issuance of tokens and the building of the treasury.</p><p>In our podcast DAO example, the podcaster would create a Juicebox project. They can define various parameters that dictate how the project will operate, like funding targets, the exchange rate, payouts, and the number of tokens reserved for founders. The Juicebox project has an associated token: <code>$PODC</code>. To contribute to the podcast DAO's treasury, I would head to the project's page on <a href="https://juicebox.money" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://juicebox.money</a>, connect my Metamask wallet and contribute ETH. In exchange, I would get some <code>$PODC</code> token based on the Juicebox project's predefined exchange rate.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="gnosis"><strong>Gnosis</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#gnosis" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Who "owns" the treasury? A single person <em>could</em> own the treasury, but nothing is stopping them from running off with the bag besides reputational risk.</p><p>Enter: the multi-signature wallet, commonly known as a "multisig". A multisig is fundamentally a contract that can hold assets and execute transactions, with one exception: it requires the signature of <em>more than one</em> address to execute transactions. Just like a business where you need multiple signatures to do anything, a multisig requires some number of signatures (typically <code>m</code> of <code>n</code>, say, 2 signatures out of 3 signatories) to execute a given transaction.</p><p>So, when setting up the podcast DAO, we would create a multisig between the podcast founders (say, the 2 podcasts hosts and any other significant contributors). The multisig would be the owner of the Juicebox project. This allows us to have multiple individuals controlling the parameters for fundraising so that no individual can go rogue.</p><p><a href="https://gnosis-safe.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gnosis</a> is the go-to tool for creating and managing multisigs. It provides a clean and simple UI to enable the management of a multisig. Signatories connect their Metamask wallet and can approve and reject transactions from Gnosis.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="snapshot"><strong>Snapshot</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#snapshot" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>How do you vote with your DAO tokens? <a href="https://Snapshot.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snapshot.org</a>! Snapshot is an off-chain voting tool used to propose and vote on changes to the DAO. It leverages IPFS to store votes.</p><p>A proposal is just a document that lays out some change to the DAO and gives a single choice amongst multiple options in a voting mechanism. Anybody holding the DAO's token can vote on a proposal for which result they prefer. For example, someone might create a proposal on Snapshot that a certain person is interviewed as a guest on the podcast. As a <code>$PODC</code> holder, I can navigate to the proposal on <a href="http://Snapshot.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snapshot.org</a> and vote yes or no. The weighting of my vote is proportional to the amount of <code>$PODC</code> I hold.</p><p>A proposal is accepted by the DAO when a certain number of votes is reached (say, two-thirds, or 67%). When a proposal is accepted, it is the responsibility of the multisig signatories to carry out the proposal.</p><p>Importantly, there is an element of trust required for this to work effectively. At the end of the day, the multisig signatories have complete control over the treasury, and they have to be willing to carry out the wishes of the DAO. This risk is mitigated by the nature of the multisig: because it requires multiple signatures, the likelihood of coordination amongst bad-acting signatories is somewhat mitigated. Reputation is on the line, too, so signatories are somewhat incentivized to act in the best interest of the DAO.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="aragon"><strong>Aragon</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#aragon" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>As noted above, Snapshot voting happens off-chain, but on-chain voting is possible. In comparison, <a href="https://aragon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aragon</a> provides on-chain voting. With Aragon, no aspect of the DAO is happening in your web browser. Instead, absolutely everything would be executed as a transaction on the blockchain. In some sense, this makes the DAO more decentralized, but also a little bit less agile and quite a bit more expensive to interact with.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="takeaways"><strong>Takeaways</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#takeaways" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>DAOs are becoming more and more popular, and there is no single playbook for creating a DAO. We are in an ecosystem of DAO tooling. Juicebox, Gnosis, Snapshot, Aragon are composable tools that can be mixed and matched with each other to create the infrastructure that is a single DAO. Each DAO will make different choices about which pieces of tooling and what level of decentralization is appropriate for their project and goals.</p><hr><p>Follow [<a href="https://twitter.com/aeolianeth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@aeolianeth</a>] on Twitter.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>In its first funding cycle, each project issues 1,000,000 tokens for each 1 ETH received.</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="level-0">Level 0<a class="hash-link" href="#level-0" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In its simplest form, a Juicebox project can be configured to fundraise and provide refunds. </p><p>Example: I pay 5 ETH into a treasury and receive 5,000,000 tokens, and you pay 5 ETH and receive 5,000,000 tokens. There are now 10 ETH in the treasury and 10,000,000 tokens total. Since I own half of the tokens, I can redeem them to get half of the treasury's total – in other words I can get a refund. You can do the same.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="level-1">Level 1<a class="hash-link" href="#level-1" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A reserved rate can be added which will allocate a percentage of the minted token supply to a preprogrammed list of addresses.</p><p>Example: The project sets a 10% reserved rate that goes to the DAO's multisig address. I pay 5 ETH into a treasury and receive 4,500,000 tokens, and you pay 5 ETH and receive 4,500,000 tokens. The DAO's multisig now has access to 1,000,000 tokens. Because of the reserved rate, I can no longer redeem my tokens to get a refund – I will only get 90% of what I paid. </p><p>At a reserved rate of 100%, no tokens go to new contributors.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="level-2">Level 2<a class="hash-link" href="#level-2" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A funding cycle target can be set which blocks off some funds from the treasury that can be distributed by anyone to a set of preprogrammed addresses.</p><p>Example: The project sets a target of 1 ETH. I pay 5 ETH into a treasury and receive 5,000,000 tokens, and you pay 5 ETH and receive 5,000,000 tokens.
The treasury now has 10 ETH – &nbsp;1 ETH is within the target, and the other 9 are considered overflow. I can redeem/burn by tokens to receive my proportion of the overflow, which is 4.5 ETH. The 1 ETH target is still distributable to the project and not accessible to token holders.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="level-3">Level 3<a class="hash-link" href="#level-3" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A redemption bonding curve can be added which reduces the amount of the treasury that can be reclaimed by redeeming tokens. </p><p>Example: The project sets a 50% bonding curve. I pay 5 ETH to the treasury and receive 5,000,000 tokens, and you pay 5 ETH and receive 5,000,000 tokens. Because of the redemption bonding curve, I will only receive ~2.5 ETH if I redeem my tokens. The rest is left to share by those who are holding, so you could now redeem your tokens and get the remaining ~7.5 ETH.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="level-4">Level 4<a class="hash-link" href="#level-4" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A discount rate can be added to decrease the rate of tokens that are minted and distributed when contributions are received over time. </p><p>Example: The project sets a 10% discount rate and a 14 day funding cycle duration. &nbsp;I pay 5 ETH to the treasury and receive 5,000,000 tokens on day one during the first funding cycle. Fourteen days later during the second funding cycle, you pay 5 ETH and receive 4,500,000 tokens.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="level-5">Level 5<a class="hash-link" href="#level-5" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>It is important to note that a project can change its reserved rate, target, redemption bonding curve, and discount rate on a per-funding cycle basis. Some projects might choose to have no funding cycle duration for the most flexibility, meaning they can reconfigure the project on demand. It is really important to trust the owner of the project because they have a lot of control to shape the tokenomics. </p><p>A project can also set a ballot contract in its funding cycle to create conditions according to which all proposed reconfigurations must abide.</p><p>Example: The project sets a 3-day delay ballot contract. If the project owner wants to reconfigure any funding cycle property, the transaction to do so must be sent at least 3 days before the end of the current funding cycle. If the reconfiguration was made within the 3 days, the next funding cycle will instead be a copy of the current one, and the reconfiguration would be eligible to take effect after that one.</p><p>People can build arbitrary ballot contracts as long as it conforms to <a href="https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v1/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IFundingCycleBallot.sol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IFundingCycleBallot</a>.</p>]]></content>

Here's <a href="/juicebox-postmortem-of-low-severity-bug-discovered-8-18-2021/">more</a>.
3. There is no direct burn transaction, but tokens will be burnt when redeemed. Therefor in order to burn, reconfigure your target such that there is overflow, then redeem tokens and then inject the overflow back into the treasury.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From the <a href="/multi-layer-juicebox/">original post</a>: </p><blockquote><p>The simplest option would be to just deploy the same Juicebox protocol in each EVM compatible L2 environment. This forces projects to choose which they would like to operate on, or manage their own complexity if they would like to operate across many. I'm guessing most projects would prefer to operate everywhere, if only it were easy to do so.</p></blockquote><p>What if the simplest option was the best option?</p><p>Although deploying the same Juicebox protocol in each EVM compatible L2 environment forces projects to choose which they would like to operate on, it might be most reasonable to pass along this choice and complexity to each project while suggesting thorough operational strategies to weave these isolated environments together at the DAO/social/governance layer.</p><p>Here are some potential operational guidelines, using JuiceboxDAO as an example:</p><ul><li>Juicebox protocol is deployed identically on several L2s and side chains. JuiceboxDAO creates a project on each one where fees will be collected and contributions accepted.</li><li>JuiceboxDAO will have different tokens on each chain. JuiceboxDAO membership is composed of a strategy that take each of these tokens into account. Members are responsible for managing the entirety of the DAO's treasury across all chains.</li><li>JuiceboxDAO submits treasury reconfigurations to each chain independently. Each chain can have funding cycles that operate on different schedules, have different token issuance rates, and different ETH distributions. This flexibility can be used to orchestrate arbitrary multi-chain treasury designs, although also introducing management overhead. Extend to new environments responsibly.</li><li>JuiceboxDAO can move its ETH/tokens between environments adhering to the constraints of each chain, leaning on existing and upcoming generalized bridging infrastructure.</li><li>It can deploy converter contracts if it wishes to support conversions between each of its membership tokens.</li></ul><p>Any other project could choose to operate on one or many environments where the Juicebox protocol has been deployed. If they choose to operate on many, they would have to manage the complexity of doing so. Once projects have begun experimenting and settling on effective patterns, I'd hope a playbook would emerge as a reference for future projects.</p><p>Leaving multi-layer coordination for the social layer introduces some operational overhead and risk, but also keeps the protocol layer flexible and simple.</p>]]></content>

If instead we preemptively consider how we can adjust the Juicebox V2 protocol to make cross layer operation simple for us, we'll likely also be making it simple for all projects who choose to build around juicebox treasuries.</p><p>An effective solution will take into consideration that:</p><ul><li><strong>projects do not want to fragment its community and governance across chains.</strong> All members should be cheering for funds to come in from wherever people care to contribute from, and the project's distributed tokens in turn should provide the opportunity to govern its cumulative funds regardless of what chain they're on. </li><li><strong>the issuance rate of the project's tokens should be synchronizable across all available environments over time.</strong> As funding cycles roll over, it's often the case that the weight of token distribution changes. Unless it is by design, there shouldn't be arbitrage opportunities across chains. </li><li><strong>funding cycle reconfigurations should either be approved or fail across all environments.</strong> If a project proposes to reconfigure its funding parameters in one environment but the ballot to do so ends up failing, the change should also fail to take effect in all other environments. On the flip side, successful funding cycle reconfigurations should be reflected across chains.</li></ul><hr><p><em>Stay tuned for specific proposals from me of how this might be achieve across rollup L2s, and please contribute to the conversation with your own ideas so we can arrive at the best possible set of solutions together.</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>thoughts in progress. feedback always welcome. plz add to the conversation and let me know if i'm missing some context, it can be hard to keep up with it all.</em></p><p>ConstitutionDAO has reached some sort of a coordination moment. There are decisions to be made both technically and socially, and the PEOPLE will have their first opportunity to really use their voice.</p><p>Meanwhile us builders have another opportunity to evaluate and extend our current tooling to best support moments like this for people into the future.</p><p>Things we care about when considering refund design: speed, safety, cost, flexibility, convenience, (...?). </p><p>In the case of ConstitutionDAO, the refund could be handled in a few different ways (there are definitely others that I don't know of or am less familiar with):</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="do-it-through-juicebox">Do it through Juicebox<a class="hash-link" href="#do-it-through-juicebox" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Steps:</p><ol><li>Inject the $40+ million back into the Juicebox contract.</li><li>Multisig sends a tx reconfiguring ConstitutionDAO's funding cycle target to 0, allowing all tokens to be redeemable for a proportional share of all funds in the treasury.</li><li>Everyone who wants to redeem their PEOPLE tokens can do so. All who wish to stay in and build out ConstitutionDAO can instead keep their PEOPLE tokens and leave their funds committed to the group.</li><li>The DAO eventually reassess what it wants out of itself, and who will serve on the multisig to continuing operating the treasury on the community's behalf. DAO can also reassess if it wishes to open up to new members and contributions, etc. In other words, DAO continues to do DAO shit. </li></ol><p>Notes: </p><ul><li>-- I'd prefer if the Juicebox contracts were looked through by several more people before sticking $40+ mil in them. I personally trust them, but we need community trust and acknowledgement that this is risky experimental stuff. I would love to have the community's confidence in this decision. I'd love to do workshops over the next few days toward this end.</li><li>-- Every person claiming would have a gas fee to pay that would cost about the same as it costed them to contribute: $30-$60 bucks worth of ETH. This sucks especially for folks who contributed amounts around the same order of magnitude as the fee.</li><li>++ This would require minimal coordination, everyone can take whatever action they choose, whenever they choose to.</li><li>++ As the Juicebox process is being audited, the DAO could begin manually issuing refunds right away to people who send in their PEOPLE tokens to the multisig.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="multisig-manually-sends-refunds-to-those-who-want-it">Multisig manually sends refunds to those who want it<a class="hash-link" href="#multisig-manually-sends-refunds-to-those-who-want-it" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><em>I saw versions of this idea from <a href="https://twitter.com/strangechances" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@strangechances</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/DennisonBertram" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@DennisonBertram</a>, and </em>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A project's overflowed funds in the Juicebox protocol can serve various purposes depending on the configuration choices the project makes.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A project's overflowed funds in the Juicebox protocol can serve various purposes depending on the configuration choices the project makes. </p><p>A reminder, overflow is the amount of funds currently in a project's Juicebox treasury minus its current funding cycle's <code>target</code>, which specifies the amount allowed to be distributed from the treasury to preprogrammed addresses during the cycle. A project's token holders can burn their tokens at any point to receive a proportional amount of the project's overflow. This proportion can be affected by a <code>bondingCurve</code> also configured per funding cycle. A curve of 100% is a linear proportion.</p><p>Here are outlines of how a project's funding cycles might be configured to use its overflow for achieving various treasury designs:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="refund">Refund<a class="hash-link" href="#refund" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Overflow can be used to give all contributors access to their money back in the case of an unsuccessful campaign. </p><p>In the case of ConstitutionDAO, the project's first funding cycle is configured with a <code>target</code> of <code>uint256.max</code>, which allows free movement of any funds accumulated in Juicebox into preprogrammed addresses (the Gnosis multisig wallet). It is also set up with a <code>duration</code> of 0, which gives the project's owner (also the Gnosis multisig wallet) authority to trigger a new reconfigured funding cycle at any point. All ETH contributed mints a proportional amount of the project's tokens for the contributor.</p><p>The multisig could thus reconfigure the project to have a <code>target</code> of 0 and then inject all of its raised funds back into its Juicebox treasury, which would make all funds in the project considered overflow and therefor claimable by token holders. With the <code>bondingCurve</code> at 100%, each token holder could then burn their supply to receive the same amount of ETH they originally put in.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ragequit">Ragequit<a class="hash-link" href="#ragequit" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A project can use its overflow to allow disenchanted token holders to exit and take with them a portion of the treasury's funds.</p><p>Only a project's overflowed funds in Juicebox are available to be claimed by burning tokens. If a project's funds are mostly kept in a multisig (or other contracts/assets), they cannot not be taken into account in the redemption value of a token (changing in V2). A project can thus tune the expected return of ragequitting by injecting liquid funds back into Juicebox, adjusting its <code>target</code> value, and loosing/tightening its bonding curve.</p><p>If a project is spending its raised funds at a faster rate than it is pulling in funds, or if the project's rate of token distribution has changed over time, it's likely ragequitting via the built in juicebox mechanism won't yield the same amount as initially contributed.</p><p><em>Shouts to MolochDAO for coining the term "ragequit".</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cash-back">Cash-back<a class="hash-link" href="#cash-back" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A project that sells products can use its overflow to give customers the opportunity for cash-back. </p><p>TileDAO, for example, currently sells artwork for 0.16 ETH. When works are minted, the sale price is piped into the TileDAO treasury, minting the project's tokens for the buyer in return. TileDAO might want to give its token holders incentive to hold these tokens by giving them utility, perhaps decision making weight in governance, otherwise holders might want to redeem them for some of the project's treasury. This redemption would essentially give the buyer of the art some cash back, the value of which determined by several aspects of the project's funding cycle choices over time.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="realizable-profits">Realizable profits<a class="hash-link" href="#realizable-profits" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A project can inject funds into its treasury from arbitrary sources, giving all token holders access to them by burning tokens. </p><p>The simplest example here would be a project that gathers funds via a Juicebox project to purchase a thing, then turns around and sells the thing for more than what it paid. The funds from the sale can then be injected back into the Juicebox project for token holders to claim if they choose to do so.</p><hr><p>Consistent through all of these examples are consequential choices that a project can make to offer its community particular treasury designs over time. The address that controls the NFT representing a Juicebox project has the power to make these choices. Whichever EOA or contract stewarding this responsibility on a community's behalf should be scrutinized and held accountable to the extent each community sees fit. </p><p>Hopefully what these examples make clear is that the tokens issued by projects using the Juicebox protocol have no intrinsic value. They can, however, be used by projects as a utility for making decisions, the outcomes of which can give them value. It all depends on the choices we make together over time, and the social and algorithmic contracts we use to make these choices binding.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As funds are contributed to the JuiceboxDAO treasury – either as direct payments or as fees paid – JBX is minted and distributed. Currently, 35% of these are reserved and allocated to preprogrammed addresses while the remaining 65% are sent to the contributor of the payment. </p><p>The current distribution of reserved tokens for JuiceboxDAO is as follows:
<img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image-5-891bec90adcfd3d96bf1ba8a6626d9a9.png" width="1084" height="672" class="img_ev3q">
There is no cap to how many JBX are minted into existence: as more ETH is contributed, more JBX is created, albeit at a slightly decreasing rate over time due to the discount rate (currently 10% fewer JBX minted per ETH every 2 weeks). With each payment, the pie being shared grows while everyone's share of the pie slightly shrinks.</p><p>... except for those on the reserved tokens list. At any given moment, their overall JBX positions tend towards the percent of reserved tokens they're programmed to receive, at the rate of the treasury's growth. This also means that currently 35% of the DAO's value tends to concentrate between the reserved token holders, with the remaining 65% going to a long-tail distribution between those who chipped in or paid fees to the treasury over time, favoring those who did so soonest. </p><p>JuiceboxDAO's reserved tokens have thus far been mostly allocated to those few contributors shouldering operational responsibilities to the DAO. Recently the DAO also began reserving tokens for the DAO's multi-sig in order to redistribute to LP staking rewards and other programs. </p><p>Going forward, the DAO's greatest opportunity to coordinate incentives among its community will likely come through expanding the reserved pool to include many new members and campaigns with proven commitments to its success, as well as smaller scoped experimental distributions.</p><p>With a few basic guardrails and guidances in place such as those outlined in the <a href="https://juiceboxdao.notion.site/Governance-f0ff06c503914500acb9bd646cc4ed65" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DAO's governance documents</a>, the DAO should be set up to fairly and efficiently welcome in meaningful contributors, while shedding those who are no longer participating or useful. This process should spread the value the DAO creates to the people actively furthering the project's mission statement, and to the projects building on the protocol who are paying fees over time.</p><p>I'm very eager to see more reserved token allocation <a href="https://juiceboxdao.notion.site/Governance-f0ff06c503914500acb9bd646cc4ed65" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proposals</a> over the next several months, and for the number of reserved token receivers to grow substantially.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="aside">Aside<a class="hash-link" href="#aside" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The reserved rate also makes a 51% takeover very expensive. JuiceboxDAO currently has a total supply of 577,516,558 JBX tokens. Each ETH contributed mints another 544,320 JBX (353,808 to the payer, 190,512 to the reserved pool). In order for someone to mint 51% of tokens for themselves today, they would have to dump 3,865 ETH into the treasury. This will just get more expensive as time goes on since the total supply will increase over time as the number of tokens minted per ETH contributed decreases.</p>]]></content>

We anticipate one 721 contract for closed collections (where token supply is known in advance) and one open minting collection (where artist can add over time). Nico already has a closed collection contract that we can refine. Can also build a simple front-end to make this easy for artist collaborators (and the broader NFT ecosystem). </li><li>We continue to experiment with ideas about spinning NFTMKT off into its own JB project because the opportunity is large, and we believe that small teams working on focused projects are more effective than one overwhelmingly large vertically integrated JB protocol team. Perhaps initially staffed by same dev team as JB. Can focus on NFTMKT and the creator contracts. Could collect a fee for NFTs sold through the marketplace (2.5% like opensea?) or could be free. If it had revenue it would have more opportunity to expand dev team. Also thinking about token-swaps between NFTMKT and JB 📈🤝. </li><li>Increasing belief that NFTMKT will solve the DEX vs JB dilemma facing DEX-traded DAO tokens, where the DEX is always a better price than the JB, by game-theoretic definition. This limits DAOs' ability to fundraise because DEX trades do not affect DAO treasuries. NFTMKT will allow DAOs like Shark to largely replace direct-to-JB appeals. DEX purchases may still offer cheaper DAO tokens than the NFTMKT, but buyers will not get access to limited edition NFTs via the DEXes. NFTMKT will also be more fun and easy to use for NFT acclimated, compared to JB or DEXes which are unfamiliar to many in that space.</li><li>The team is <em>very</em> excited about the promising design specification and roadmap for the NFTMKT.</li><li>Nicholas also discussed with Mieos affordances in the 721 contracts that will enable WAGMI to create NFTs on behalf of client DAOs.

        <id>juicebox-v2</id>

        <updated>2021-09-03T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Current state of things]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="current-state-of-things">Current state of things<a class="hash-link" href="#current-state-of-things" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>First thing's first: a huge thank you to everyone who has played with the first version of the Juicebox protocol over the past month. You've taken a leap of faith on a very experimental and untested set of contracts and user experiences with the hopes that it would help you smoothly realize your vision. The protocol has helped a number of projects bootstrap their treasury and community, and these communities have in turn helped Juicebox root into the fertile soil that is the Ethereum social layer.</p><p>I've been observing how each project has been interacting with the protocol. I've been a part of exciting discussions where JB was a total enabler of ideas and creativity, and also ones where I've unfortunately had to be the bearer of bad news that the protocol doesn't support the wild thought being proposed. I've seen people spin up projects and raise hundreds of ETH in hours, and seen people give up on the first screen because the "button" they were trying to click wasn't actually a button. After only a few weeks of action I have a sense of what's working, and I've got a laundry list of what could be better.</p><p>The goal is to steadily improve things over time. At the base contract layer however, progress must made in big leaps initially with the goal of eventually reaching a steady state as innovation moves to subsequent application layers. JuiceboxV2 is the first big leap. Its goal is simple: to enable more creativity, and remove all points of friction.</p><p>JuiceboxV1 was designed with the assumption that communities and project owners have adverse incentives. By using Juicebox, a project owner was committing to particular constraints so that their community could confidently embrace the finances of the game being proposed. Project owners could not mint or burn tokens at will, project owners could not dictate how many tokens were minted per ETH contributed, project owners could not limit who participated in a crowdfund, and project owners did not have a pause button.</p><p>Turns out this was a bad assumption to roll with at the base protocol layer. If a community and its owners are one and the same, flexibility is a requirement for total creative expression. It turns out that communities almost always crave a custom treasury strategy that fits their ethos and proposes a game that differentiates them from others. </p><p>Projects don't usually have the engineering resources to build, test, and verify such solutions though. This has been a core value Juicebox has provided for people, along with a simple and powerful UI for community members to join in through and follow along with. So far, the frictions that Juicebox removes has justified the treasury strategy constraints that it introduces. </p><p>Let's see if we can now do even better.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="proposed-changes">Proposed changes<a class="hash-link" href="#proposed-changes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bring-your-own-mintburn-strategy">Bring your own mint/burn strategy<a class="hash-link" href="#bring-your-own-mintburn-strategy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>You'll now be able to bring your own contracts that outline the game you want to propose to your community. You'll be able to plug and play with already-written strategies, or write your own custom one that fulfills your wildest ideas.</p><p>Writing a strategy can be simple, or as complex as you want. All that is required is providing a contract that adheres to <a href="https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-juicehouse/blob/version/2/packages/hardhat/contracts/interfaces/IFundingCycleDataSource.sol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the <code>IFundingCycleDataSource</code> interface</a>. You'll be able to provide a strategy that decides what happens when someone makes a payment to your project, as well as one for when someone redeems their treasury tokens. </p><p>Here's how writing a strategy around a payment works:</p><p>You can add a data source contract as a parameter to a funding cycle.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>SharkDAO, the project using the Juicebox protocol that is moving quickest and most likely to break things, has quickly proven the need for pooling its Juicebox treasury tokens into AMMs to provide organic price discovery for its token holders. Most Juicebox projects who reach scale will likely also come across this need.</p><p>The value of SHARK is derived not only from its ETH stored in the Juicebox contracts, but also from the NFTs the DAO has deployed treasury funds to acquire, from the JBX that the DAO has begun accumulating by paying platform fees, and perhaps most importantly from the productive community forming within the project that gives it boundless potential moving forward. The prospective value of each of these assets is dynamic and subject to each individuals' confidence and risk appetite. This calls for a more fluid market making and order filling strategy than what the Juicebox protocol has provided until now.</p><p>Juicebox provides SHARK holders an effective way to fundraise and expand, but it doesn't yet provide a way for holders to coordinate a value for what they already own – this is the strength of AMMs. SharkDAO needs both of these features well into the future. If Juicebox wishes to be the go-to treasury protocol for startup projects who scale, it needs to understand how the current mechanic behaves alongside a treasury token liquidity pool, and which protocol adjustments are needed to smooth out any identified market inefficiencies over time.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="current-limitations">Current limitations<a class="hash-link" href="#current-limitations" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Currently, Juicebox treasuries have no configurable max-supply of tokens. The protocol always offers people an opportunity to pitch in ETH and receive treasury tokens in return according to the current funding cycle's weight, which is determined by the compounding effects of discount rates alongside the currently configured reserve rate.</p><p>As a reminder, the discount rate decreases the amount of tokens minted per ETH contributed as funding cycle's roll over – a discount rate of 10% to the current funding cycle means that a contribution of X ETH to the next funding cycle will only yield 90% of the tokens that the same contribution of X ETH made during the current funding cycle would yield. The reserve rate determines how many of these tokens will be reserved to be distributed to preprogrammed addresses instead of to the payer.</p><p>The protocol is thus always quoting a value for a project's treasury tokens, and inso doing always offering to inflate the supply of tokens to meet this demand in exchange for crowdfunding more ETH. It is thus unrealistic to expect the market price of treasury tokens on an AMM to ever exceed the price quoted by the protocol – the protocol will always provide a price ceiling. If the secondary market is over, there is an obvious arbitrage opportunity to pull the price back down.</p><p>There may, however, be people who received treasury tokens at a discount in the past who are now willing to sell them for profit at a better price than what the protocol is offering. This supply-side pressure happens organically as funding cycles unfold and discount rates compound. On the buy-side, it's logical for someone to seek a better deal for treasury tokens from this secondary market than get them from the protocol. If the majority of activity is happening on secondaries beneath the protocol price, the token supply and fundraising efforts will tapper off at this equilibrium.</p><p>The big question thus becomes how a project chooses to pursue this equilibrium. Does it tune its discount rate and reserve rate over time with its own fairness principles in mind, using secondary markets as a convenience for buyers and sellers but limiting the market's potential to naturally discover its price's upper bound? Or does it use the secondary market as a primary indicator of fairness, using the discount rate and reserved rate only to conveniently satisfy its fundraising needs over time? The answer depends on a community’s values. Does it wish to be liberally open, inclusive, and predictable while prioritizing cashflow? Or instead more-strictly protective of the value current members have accrued and took risks for, with strategic fundraising/expansion campaigns down the road that are scoped for value-adding initiatives? Maybe a balance between the two, with principles in place to guide decisions?</p><p>The Juicebox toolset has proven to work well for projects who are willing to expand supply to accommodate new funds and new community members. For projects that want to protect the value they have built and conduct more strategic and scoped fundraising campaigns over time, the compounding discount rate and reserved rate mechanisms might not work well within the current protocol's constraints.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="solutions">Solutions<a class="hash-link" href="#solutions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The solution might be simple.</p><p>For the Juicebox protocol to be able to accommodate market driven projects, it must allow them to:</p><ul><li>specify a supply cap for their treasury token, and </li><li>allow them to customize the quantity of treasury tokens that are distributed per ETH received. </li></ul><p>Under these conditions, if payments are received into the treasury after the token supply cap is exceeded, no tokens will be minted in return. Otherwise, if the project has set a customized treasury token price point, tokens will be minted according to this rate overriding the current funding cycle's weight derived by the compounding discount rates of previous cycles.</p><p>These tools allow a project to essentially "pause" new treasury tokens from being issued, and at any point open up a fixed supply of new tokens to distribute at a specified price point. The reserved rate as it currently exists can work within this pattern to route newly issued tokens to time-bounded distribution mechanisms, incentivized staking pools, the project's own multi-sig wallet, etc.</p><p>Adding these parameters does put more power into the hands of the project owner, which is a tradeoff worth noting. People who contributed funds earlier in a project's lifetime will no longer have guarantees that their tokens were issued at a discount compared to the future cycles, and protocol rates are subject to change as dramatically as the project owner desires. Communities must make extra sure that the ownership of their project (represented by an ERC-721 contract) is in the hands of a trustworthy wallet willing to execute decisions collectively agreed upon. I'm not too worried about this tradeoff because it is already true to large extent in the current implementation.</p><p>Another tradeoff of a token supply cap is that it risks the consistency of DAO-to-DAO and Anon-to-DAO collaboration. For example, imagine someone stands up an NFT marketplace that automatically routes percentages of artwork sales to preconfigured destinations, like to SharkDAO's treasury. If SharkDAO has a token supply cap in place and has reached this limit, the sale of the artwork would still send the ETH to the treasury, but the artist would not receive any SHARK in return. I'm also not too worried about this tradeoff because the same effect is possible with the current mechanism if a project tunes its reserved rate to 100%. Each project/artist composing with Juicebox treasuries should always understand the variability of doing so – rates are subject to change, and so its important to prioritize building relationships with trustworthy projects who make decisions in the open with proper planning and community engagement. </p><p>Another detail to note: the configuration of both new parameters will be scoped to funding cycle configurations – a project running on timed cycles must await a new cycle for changes to the max-supply and weight override parameters to take effect. Projects with longer funding cycle durations and more rigid reconfiguration ballots will thus continue to operate with more predictability, checks, and balances. Another effect of this is that the actual token supply might be greater than the configured max supply if the project ends up minting more tokens during a current, boundless cycle before a queued one with a max-supply becomes active.</p><p>A proposal is taking shape to implement these two new properties into a TerminalV2 contract within the Juicebox ecosystem. Projects currently running on TerminalV1 will have the option to migrate over once the contract has been deployed and approved.</p><hr><p><a href="https://discord.gg/qckstafRcs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Join the JuiceboxDAO Discord</a> to add to this discussion and provide alternate ideas and points of view before we move forward with rolling out these additions to the protocol.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I discovered a low severity bug in the Juicebox protocol last night that affects projects that have received payments while configured with a reserved rate of 0% who later reconfigure the reserved rate to anything greater than 0%.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I discovered a low severity bug in the Juicebox protocol last night that affects projects that have received payments while configured with a reserved rate of 0% who later reconfigure the reserved rate to anything greater than 0%.</p><p>A temporary work around has been identified, and a game plan for removing the bug from the system is in the works.</p><p>To mitigate potential exploits before a patch is issued, an exploit breakout team decided to mint 0.5% of total SHARK supply (1,889,066.675747 SHARK) into the multi-sig wallet. This course of action was chosen to prevent further issues. These tokens can be burned if desired.</p><p>What follows is how I discovered the bug, the technical details about it, and what our next steps will be.</p><p><strong>TLDR:**</strong>Until further notice, projects are not advised to set their reserved rate to 0% if they intend to raise their reserved rate in the near future.**</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="context">Context<a class="hash-link" href="#context" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>To give them time to plan for for what's next, SharkDAO needed a way to pause payments and new members coming in through Juicebox. Juicebox doesn't support a <code>pause</code> function in its <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xd569D3CCE55b71a8a3f3C418c329A66e5f714431" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TerminalV1</a> contract, so Peripheralist and I had to improvise alongside the SharkDAO community.
<img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image-d29654ae27cb9fb8a8daeb87c91656b5.png" width="1908" height="640" class="img_ev3q">
First step was to remove the payment form from the UI. This keeps most people from sending in contributions, but someone dedicated to sending a payment would eventually find that the Juicebox contract could still be interacted with directly through other interfaces like Etherscan.</p><p>To even the playing field, I had the idea to raise SharkDAO's reserved rate to 100%, meaning all payments coming in through the contract would allocate 100% of minted SHARK tokens to preprogrammed addresses instead of to the paying address. With no SHARK incentive for contributing payments, the community would be disincentivized to pay through back-door means, effectively creating the desired <code>pause</code> functionality. If anyone did send payments, we could easily refund them the money.</p><p>After running this plan by SharkDAO at a Sharktank town hall meeting, we decided to move forward with it. We would allocate any SHARK minted during this paused period to the multi-sig, which could later be burned if needed.</p><p>A few details to note: </p><ul><li>SharkDAO's reserved rate has been set to 0% since its start. </li><li>SharkDAO does not use funding cycles with preset durations, meaning changes can be executed on-demand. </li><li>SharkDAO's Juicebox project is owned by a Gnosis multi-sig requiring 3/5 signatures. I'm one of the signatories.</li></ul><p>Right after the call, I got together with multi-sig holders to execute the plan. After one transaction to TerminalV1's <code>configure</code> function, the reserved rate was successfully updated. I immediately checked the UI to see if things were in order – thats when I noticed that after having set the reserved rate to 100%, it was now possible to mint and distribute 100% of the current token supply to the preconfigured destination (the multi-sig). Since this distribute transaction is public, anyone who triggered this would effectively double the SHARK supply, and would leave us with unnecessary work after the fact to burn this unintended supply from the multi-sig and communicate the issue to the community.</p><p>I immediately instructed the multi-sig panel to send another <code>configure</code> transaction to TerminalV1 to change the reserved rate back to 0%, and explained that I had to double check something before we could move forward with the plan. This reverted us to the previous state, where payments made to the contract directly would bypass the intended <code>pause</code> that was being communicated in the UI.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technical-details">Technical details<a class="hash-link" href="#technical-details" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The root of the problem was fairly obvious to me once I noticed the distributable supply in the UI. Once we were back at a safer state, I began work to confirm my assumptions and test a workaround.</p><p>Many parts of the Juicebox mechanism's design are gas optimized, meaning the transactions that are most frequently called are responsible for fewer state changes than those that are infrequently called. The <code>pay</code> transaction is by far the most frequently called, so very few state changes take place within this function: the payment is received, and the resulting amount of treasury tokens are minted to the payer in a staked format.</p><p>Importantly, the reserved token amount is <em>not</em> minted during a payment. Instead, this amount is calculated later when the <code>printReservedTickets</code> transaction is called. It does so by taking the current token total supply and minting an appropriate amount of new tokens to the preconfigured reserved addresses such that the reserved rate is respected. Most importantly, the mechanism then keeps track of the fact that it has minted reserved tokens for the current token supply so that it doesn't create extra reserved tokens later. Given perfect information, it is in the economic best interest of the project to wait to call <code>printReservedTickets</code> if the reserved rate is going to increase, and in the community's interest to call it before an increase. The opposite is also true. This dynamic allows the protocol to offload a high-gas storage operation from a frequently called <code>pay</code> function onto less frequently called operations.</p><p>Unfortunately, when the reserved rate is 0%, the <code>printReservedTickets</code> call assumes there's no work to do, and returns before it has had a chance to update the tracker. This prevents anyone from locking in the rate before it is increased. In the <a href="https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juicehouse/blob/3555d7baf7fa8ba4bc350140201805c740e3df4e/packages/hardhat/contracts/TerminalV1.sol#L968" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TerminalV1 file</a>, the solution is literally just putting line 968 below line 977:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image-1-528644694da941466960bb9696b7393f.png" width="1870" height="512" class="img_ev3q">Current TerminalV1 implementation of <code>printReservedTickets</code></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="execution">Execution<a class="hash-link" href="#execution" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I immediately proposed two workarounds to the SharkDAO admins:</p><ul><li>Keep the contract open.</li><li>Set the reserved rate to the minimum possible value (0.5%), distribute the allocated reserved tokens to the multi-sig, then move the reserved rate to 100% as intended.</li></ul><p>We decided to go with the second option since we needed to set a fair playing field to community members looking to pay, and we could later burn the relatively small amount of SHARK minted to the multi-sig.</p><p>I then spent a few hours recreating the the original bug in our integration test suite, and wrote an integration test for the proposed solution to confirm it would work as expected (I was making extra sure of everything at this point in the evening.) Once everything was confirmed on my end, I got together with the multi-sig holders to execute the three transactions:</p><ol><li>Change the reserved rate to 0.5%.</li><li>Distribute reserved treasury tokens to the multi-sig. (Anyone can trigger this, so Xaix did it from his personal wallet.)</li><li>Change the reserved rate to 100%.</li></ol><p>The side effect is that 1,889,066.675747 SHARK were minted to the multi-sig. Here's a screenshot of what the UI looked like after step 1:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/Screen-Shot-2021-08-19-at-12.43.52-AM-1-80276cf97948f7bf3b9518bae0600ae8.png" width="1866" height="907" class="img_ev3q"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/Screen-Shot-2021-08-19-at-12.41.21-AM-845d3cdce886e38c2c7d5c7d5b53e685.png" width="944" height="268" class="img_ev3q">
And here's what it looks like now:

We got all of this done in about 2.5 hours.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="takeaway">Takeaway<a class="hash-link" href="#takeaway" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Despite having written extensive unit, integration, and load tests, this condition fell through the cracks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Three trends have characterized these past 30 days:]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Three trends have characterized these past 30 days:</p><ul><li>Several projects were spun up on Juicebox, entrusting the protocol to manage their money, and the JuiceboxDAO staff to help execute their treasury decisions. Several more reached out with plans to launch soon.</li><li>People came together to help crowdfund JuiceboxDAO alongside the fees paid by the first batch of projects. They all took on the laid-out risks and lent us their trust.</li><li>Some very talented, caring, insightful, passionate people showed the fuck up and want to build.</li></ul><p>It may ultimately be too early to tell, but it seems we might have not only found product market fit, we've found it across several different treasury use cases: DAOs that ship products (JuiceboxDAO, TileDAO), DAOs that collect NFTs (SharkDAO), boutique service shops (WAGMI Studios, CanuDAO), NFT galleries, and group bidding. There are still several improvements to make for each of these treasury use cases while maintaining a cohesive experience, and I see clear potential for even more diversity of ideas.</p><p>We are a little over 30 days in, this is just the beginning. I'm confident the Juicebox protocol can stretch much, much further. </p><hr><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="focus">Focus<a class="hash-link" href="#focus" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>As a DAO, we should consider focusing on the following areas:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Risk mitigation |</strong> make sure things don't go to zero.
current lead: jango, exekias</p></li><li><p><strong>UX improvements </strong>| improve and make templates for project onboarding and the project dashboard.
current lead: peripheralist</p></li><li><p><strong>Project support, education, &amp; docs |</strong> make sure JB projects have the resources they need to get started and thrive.
current lead: jango, natimuril, WAGMI Studios, CanuDAO</p></li><li><p><strong>Analytics</strong> | give projects rich insights into their community treasury.
current lead: peripheralist (, Buradorii?)</p></li><li><p><strong>Liquidity pools </strong>| add support for JB treasury tokens in secondary markets.
current lead: exekias </p></li><li><p><strong>Marketplace</strong> | give JB projects a place to sell digital goods (and physical?) which pipe percentages of revenue to any number of addresses and juicebox treasuries.
current lead: jango, nicholas, peripheralist</p></li><li><p><strong>Governance</strong> | plan out how we will make decisions together.
current lead: zheug (, unicornio?)</p></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-proposal-for-fc3">My proposal for FC#3:<a class="hash-link" href="#my-proposal-for-fc3" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 14 days (no change)
I think we can find a nice pace with 14 day funding cycles. Let's stick with this.</p><p><strong>Ballot:</strong> 7 day buffer (no change)
A reconfiguration proposal must be submitted 7 days before the end of the current funding cycle. I think we can get the hang of having the opportunity to vote on proposals every other week, with decisions made one week prior to them taking effect. &nbsp;This time frame is only possible thanks to CanuDAO, who's staff is managing our communications and operations. They've done a marvelous job getting things organized and keeping everyone on the same page. </p><p><strong>Discount rate:</strong> 10% (-6%)
The discount rate should be further reduced by 6%. This is arbitrary, but it continues to give those who commit funds during FC#3 a good discounted rate to adjust for the risk of being early while continuing the process of tapering the rate off.</p><p>The goal is to reduce the rate over time as risk subsides (code risk, infrastructure risk, usability risk, organization risk, governance risk).</p><p>It pays to be early and to take the risk sooner rather than later.</p><p><strong>Bonding curve:</strong> 60% (+-0%)
No need to change this. Still arbitrary, but there's no demand to redeem right now, so might as well keep it this tight as we adjust the discount rate.</p><p><strong>Payouts: </strong>$71k total (including $40k bug bounty that could be returned if unused)</p><p>I propose we raise the target to properly hire the people and projects who are already showing up and making things flow and grow, and experiment with payouts to a few up-and-coming contributors.</p><p>This also allows core contributors to embed themselves in the communities of emerging projects built with Juicebox and have cash-on-hand to support those they believe in. Actively supporting these communities is everything.</p><p><strong>Core contributors</strong></p><ul><li><strong>jango </strong>| <em>dev: $10k</em>
Lead.</li><li><strong>peripheralist </strong>| <em>dev : $10k</em>
Peripheralist has not only built the Juicebox website and been improving it since launch, he also successfully launched TileDAO around a gorgeous art project he wrote. He's got first hand experience leading a community and business around a Juicebox treasury. There's no better dev to have on board.</li><li><strong>CanuDAO </strong>|<em>comms:$2.5k</em>
Since CanuDAO's staff, zeugh and mvh3030, joined our community and gotten to work, everything seems to be running smoother. They keep our Discord organized, help with community onboarding, make sure everyone is heard and treated with respect, and makes sure the rest of the contributors can continue working towards what's ahead. </li></ul><p>This payout is an investment in CanuDAO, we'll get their juicebox project's treasury tokens in return.</p><ul><li><strong>WAGMI Studios </strong>| <em>art, animations, and educational content: $2.5k</em>
WAGMI Studios is working towards putting out art, animations, and visual assets that strengthen and add color and character to the concepts that we're working on. This will increasingly important going forward as we reach beyond a crypto-native audience.</li></ul><p>This payout is an investment in WAGMI Studios, we'll get their juicebox project's treasury tokens in return.</p><p><strong>Experimental contributors</strong></p><ul><li><strong>exekias </strong>| <em>dev : $3k</em>
Since Juicebox's launch, exekias has helped write infrastructure contracts for piping marketplace royalties back to Juicebox treasuries, helped with dev ops, and helped tease out complex ideas out with the rest of the team. More importantly, he launched WikiTokenDAO – he has first hand experience with dev onboarding onto Juicebox, getting a Juicebox treasury funded, and building a community around it. We want him on our team.</li><li><strong>nicholas</strong> | <em>dev: $1.5k</em>
We need someone who can help us create a generalized NFT marketplace template that pipes a project's sales into Juicebox treasuries. This has emerged as a need for several projects in the ecosystem. Nicholas has been working on a product called NFTstory for the past several months and is intimately familiar with the ERC-721 standard and how it can be improved and extended. He's expressed interest in working with me to take this project on, he just might be the perfect dev for it. Let's see how things go.</li><li><strong>natimuril </strong>| <em>project support</em>: $500
Projects that are building on Juicebox tend to need someone to be available for questions, ideation, and support. Natimuril will start helping us out with need, and eventually take on the responsibility fully herself. If all goes well, her idea is to operationalize her process and grow a collective around this community service effort.</li><li><strong>Buradorii</strong> | <em>analytics: $500</em>
We need someone who can help form and execute queries on the treasury data that Juicebox projects are putting out, turn these into visual dashboards, and help to tell stories from the data. Buradorii has begun experimenting with running Dune analytics queries over the past week, and seems to be getting the hang of it. </li></ul><p><strong>Allocations</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Bug Bounty</strong> | $40k
A total of $20k to pay out to whitehat hackers who report vulnerabilities. Payouts will be according to bug severity. Moe info coming soon.
This payout will be returned to the treasury if unused.</li><li><strong>Figma</strong>, <strong>Infura</strong>, <strong>Gitbook</strong>, <strong>Mee6</strong> &amp; <strong>Fleek subscriptions</strong> | $500</li></ul><p><strong>Reserved rate:</strong> 35% (+ 10%)
The reserve rate should increase by 10%. We should continue to allocate 25% to core contributors, and we should add an additional 10% for ETH/JBX liquidity provider incentives.</p><p><strong>Reserved token distribution:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>jango: </strong>35%</li><li><strong>peripheralist:</strong> 35%</li><li><strong>CanuDAO:</strong> 10%</li><li><strong>WAGMI Studios:</strong> 10%</li><li><strong>exekias</strong>: 7.5%</li><li><strong>misc:</strong> 2.5% - for on-demand incentives paid out by the multisig wallet.</li></ul><hr><p>There are still no guarantees for future payouts to anyone mentioned here, including myself. We'll have to come together over time to reassess allocations based on how things go, including pay increases and reserved JBX to experimental contributors who prove to be invaluable to the community over time.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>JuiceboxDAO's second funding cycle will have the following goals:</p><ul><li>Continue working with projects that have expressed interest in launching using the Juicebox protocol as its treasury. There's at least one project slated to deploy over the next few weeks.</li><li>Get the community organized: Discord, voting, roles, etc. We will organize and execute a community vote to determine the configuration of FC#3.</li><li>Build UIs for projects to access back office stuff like creating direct payment addresses, transfer project ownership, and allow operators to access UI components currently only accessible to owners.</li><li>Get the hang of writing Dune analytics queries to start visualizing Juicebox protocol data. The goal is to provide this data to projects using Juicebox.</li><li>Continue outreach efforts to broader Ethereum communities on Twitter and Discord.</li></ul><hr><p>I propose the following reconfiguration:</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 14 days
Let's experiment with a shorter cycle to see what happens. It gives us scope for one solid sprint with the goal of involving more of the community in the next reconfiguration decision. </p><p>As the project matures, I expect more planned out, longer cycles instead of these shorter ones.</p><p><strong>Ballot:</strong> 3 day buffer
A reconfiguration proposal must be submitted 3 days before the end of the funding cycle.</p><p><strong>Discount rate:</strong> 16% (-4%)
The discount rate should be reduced by 4%. This continues to give those who commit funds during FC#2 a good discounted rate to adjust for the risk of being early, but begins the process of tapering the rate off.</p><p>The goal is to reduce the rate over time to make a contribution during FC#1 valued around 2X the same contribution made 6 months later. </p><p>It pays to be early and to take the risk sooner rather than later.</p><p><strong>Bonding curve:</strong> 60% (no change)
There's relatively little overflow, and the JBX distribution is still narrow. No need to change this.</p><p><strong>Payouts: </strong>$10,750 total</p><ul><li><strong>jango:</strong> $4k

The reserve rate should be increased 15%. This gives me and my fellow founding contributors room to add a slight incentive bump for ourselves (we've been busier than we imagined right out of the gate), and to allocate new distributions.

        <updated>2021-08-03T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Juicebox was deployed 19 days ago.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Juicebox was deployed 19 days ago.</p><p>Here are the things that have become clearer to me by being a part of JuiceboxDAO, TileDAO, and helping a number of founding contributors of other projects design Juicebox configurations for deployments of their own:</p><ul><li><strong>Juicebox is flexible. </strong>
The protocol has the capacity to power several project operation styles. This is great, but can also be overwhelming to project owners exploring their options. It's very helpful for founders and communities to have a Juicebox "expert" that can help them translate their needs into a Juicebox config, along with a catalogue showcasing several examples of how their project might behave given certain choices.</li><li><strong>Juicebox projects can be very much "alive".</strong>
Instead of baking in a token distribution schedule ahead of time, communities using Juicebox are given the freedom to experiment and refine their strategy together over time (they could also lock it in forever from the start if they want). With this power comes great responsibility, however. Communities need great data and community analytics to make decisions with confidence.</li><li><strong>A funding cycle's duration matters. </strong>
Quicker cycles give a community more opportunities to make experimental decisions together, more frequent group calls-to-action, and more chances to debate and reassess their commitments. This creates a greater sense of communal experience over the same amount of time – a project matures more in a month using 7 day funding cycles than 30 day cycles. </li></ul><p>The tradeoff is the more immediate need for structure, organization, and formalities. There is hardly time to observe and think on a thesis before taking it to a vote. The constant attention on governance and decision making can also get exhausting and distract from medium/longer term initiatives.</p><p>A project might want to tune its pacing over time to play with these dynamics.</p><ul><li><strong>Discount rate is the most consequential configurable parameter. </strong>
Once a discount rate is set and tokens begin being distributed, its effects, however subtle, are felt long into the future. This is by design, but it can be easy for a project to let several funding cycles pass forgetting that they had previously set a discount rate. </li><li><strong>Tuning the reserved rate comes with a time-dependent tradeoff.</strong>
A community is composed of core contributors, users, and casual contributors – all play an important role in a community's growth. </li></ul><p>Core contributors are paying the most attention, doing the most work, and contributing the most upfront money. They tend to know of the tokens issued by the Juicebox protocol and their value before contributing, and thus have a conscious incentive to grow the network <em>now </em>according to the reserved rate.</p><p>Users tend to get involved mostly for the product or ideas being advertised. They only realize <em>later</em> that inso doing they've been given tokens by the Juicebox protocol that allow them to benefit from their community's growth over time.</p><p>Casual contributors of a community emerge from users who realize they can participate in giving the tokens they've been receiving more value by paying incrementally more attention and doing incrementally more work. </p><p>The reserved rate can thus be tuned to either boost the incentives of core contributors now at the expense of the incentives of emerging contributors later on, or vice versa. </p><p>This dynamic can of course be tuned over time.</p><ul><li><strong>Juicebox works really well for communities who build products.</strong> There is no better way to fund a treasury than by piping in revenue from direct sales made off-site. Tiles are a great example: sales made on <a href="https://tiles.art" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tiles.art</a> go directly to TileDAO's treasury without the purchaser concerning themselves with the money pool ahead of time. Sure, the value of owning a Tile may in large part come from the community aspect of the DAO and the shared governance of its money, but having a brilliant, intriguing product that people want to buy is what makes the treasury worth governing in the first place.</li></ul>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From my point of view, JuiceboxDAO has only a handful of big-picture initiatives to focus our efforts on over the next while:</p><ul><li>Be available to help founders and communities get started with the Juicebox protocol with confidence. This includes creating more education materials and improving technical documentation. </li><li>Build community analytics dashboards so communities can see how funding cycle reconfigurations have impacted their treasury over time, and so they can make better decisions into the future. This will also be useful so communities can cross reference decisions previously made by other Juicebox projects before making a similar decision themselves. </li><li>Build L2 payment terminals so projects can receive funds on various Ethereum L2s (Optimism, Arbitrum, ZKSync, etc). I've designed the general structure of this mechanism, but it needs to be implemented.</li><li>As more projects choose to manage their treasury using the Juicebox protocol, the protocol's TerminalV1 contract will become responsible for securing an increasing amount of ETH. It will be possible for JuiceboxDAO to write and publish a TerminalV2 contract for projects to migrate onto that sends idle overflowed ETH to a yield earning vault. This will introduce a new risk vector, so this effort can wait until the protocol has matured and the expected return is favorable.</li><li>Organize the JuiceboxDAO's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/6jXrJSyDFf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a> and the DAO's voting mechanics on <a href="https://snapshot.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snapshot</a>, and continue providing structure and financial support to incoming contributors.</li><li>Decentralize power over the JuiceboxDAO's governance over time by installing funding cycle ballots that rely on a more trustless execution of the outcome. <a href="https://aragon.org/aragon-govern" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aragon Govern</a> could help here.</li></ul><p>Each of these deserves a more detailed post of its own. </p><p>If you want to help, join the JuiceboxDAO on <a href="https://discord.gg/6jXrJSyDFf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a> and speak up. We are looking to fund people to both lead these efforts and/or contribute to them.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Juicebox protocol was launched with a governance contract controlled by a multisig wallet. There are 4 EOAs on the multisig, and 2 of the 4 must approve a transaction for it to be submitted to the Ethereum blockchain. I am a signer, along with @peripheralist, @nervetrip, and @NMieos. </p><p>This multisig wallet has the power to propose reconfigurations to the JuiceboxDAO's Juicebox project.</p><p>The multisig vows to make decisions honoring the community's intent, but it is still ambiguous how the community's intent will be captured going forward. For the next few weeks, expect reconfigurations discussions to be lead by the founding contributors and take community discussion into account. </p><p>Decisions made by this multisig wallet can only affect the JuiceboxDAO's treasury, not of projects built using the Juicebox protocol.</p><p>To be clear, I absolutely do not want to be a multisig signer long into the future – I feel I have already been entrusted with too much influence over the project's direction as a protocol developer and active community member. I also recognize and am OK with the fact that I am among the best people right now to approve of decisions that impact the treasury, and so I will carry on multisig duties as long as the community needs me to. After all, the project is still new to the party and finding its groove.</p><p>My main job right now is to help the project find its groove. This means helping out core contributors of other projects who have expressed interest using the Juicebox protocol, being a supporting community member of projects who have already integrated the Juicebox protocol, and identifying yet-to-be-built services that each community who uses the Juicebox protocol could benefit from while proposing ways for JuiceboxDAO to use our resources to address these needs.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first JuiceboxDAO configuration includes a bonding curve rate of 60%.</p><p>The Juicebox Protocol's bonding curve implementation can be seen in code <a href="https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juicehouse/blob/1c7edfd9a30299a1c9f366f31b0711fc3c11af57/packages/hardhat/contracts/TerminalV1.sol#L209" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, and interactively <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/sp9ru6zbpk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. In the interactive model, <code>o</code> is the current amount of overflow, <code>s</code> is the currently total supply of tokens, and <code>r</code> is the bonding curve. The <code>x-axis</code> is the amount of tokens being redeemed, and the <code>y-axis</code> is the amount of overflow that can be claimed by redeeming the <code>x-axis</code> amount.</p><p>A 60% curve thus means that one JBX can be redeemed (burned) for a little over 0.6 times its proportional value of JuiceboxDAO's overflow. For example, If you owned 1% of all JBX and there was 100 ETH of overflow, redeeming all of your JBX would earn you about 0.6 ETH.</p><p>In effect, a bonding curve creates an incentive to hodl tokens longer than others. The lower the bonding curve, the more this effect becomes exaggerated. The curve does nothing if there is no overflow.</p><p>The rate of 60% that we deployed with is somewhat arbitrary – we had no expectations for overflow anyways. Expect a better hypothesis for future funding cycle reconfigurations after we've had a chance to study its effects in practice.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first JuiceboxDAO configuration includes a discount rate of 20%.</p><p>This means that a contribution made to the JuiceboxDAO project during this funding cycle will mint you 20% more tokens than a contribution of the same value made during next funding cycle.</p><p>The Juicebox protocol supports discount rates from 0%-20%. The rates are compounded over time, meaning a constant rate of 10% over two funding cycles would make the relative discount between contributions on either end 81% (10% of 100 is 90. 10% of 90 is 9. 100 - 10 - 9 = 81).</p><p>The discount rate is mega powerful and has lasting effects. It should not be used arbitrarily. </p><p>Our reasoning for going with the max of 20% is that there's inherently much more risk to funding the project at its onset – the protocol is raw and untested in the wild, there are no trends to latch on to for financial speculation, and there are lots of unanswered questions still floating around. Any contributions made during this funding cycle are risky. We wanted to reward them as much as possible.</p><p>We plan on proposing a reduction of this rate to 10% for the next funding cycle, 5% for the following cycle, and settle on a constant rate of 0.5-3% from then on to keep a slight constant pressure to fund the project sooner rather than later. Expect this schedule to be reevaluated over time, but the philosophy behind its purpose as a risk offset to hold true.</p><p>Notice: Each project built using the Juicebox protocol as its treasury pays a standard 5% fee from its payouts to the JuiceboxDAO. This fee is treated like every other payment made, so each project receives JBX tokens in return. The discount rate thus also gives projects an incentive to compose with Juicebox sooner rather than later.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A question was posed in the Juicebox Discord server earlier today from @jessewldn:]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A question was posed in the <a href="https://discord.gg/2K5Cs7e76K" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicebox Discord server</a> earlier today from <a href="https://twitter.com/jessewldn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@jessewldn</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I’m curious if you’ve thought about if/how Juicebox projects might intersect with VC financing where there’s a large amount of “permanent” runway parked in one go that can’t be recalled. Do you think that’s just overflow, or is there a way to fine tune things to accommodate a project that wants to raise from a fluid/liquid community and from longer term investors simultaneously?</p></blockquote><p><strong>TLDR answer:</strong> just stick money in the protocol for the specific project. The system works the same for everyone. </p><p>This question deserves a more colorful answer though.*</p><ul><li><em>Everything that follows is theory. I'd love to experiment with these ideas in practice, tuning parameters over time until we strike the right balance for both the big fish involved, the apes, the punks, the creators, the devs, and every other Etherean.</em></li></ul><p><em>Also must note that Juicebox is experimental software. I did everything I could to thoroughly blast the protocol with tests, including regular, edge case, and randomized conditions. Formally however, it's still unaudited. Put money in the contracts at your own risk.</em></p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="primer">Primer<a class="hash-link" href="#primer" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The Juicebox protocol is meant to support small projects with big ambitions, alongside large projects that want to involve their day-to-day users/community in its growth efforts and outcomes. Meanwhile, it's meant to give patrons and investors of various risk profiles confidence over their spending and their financial positions. </p><p>A project is able to evolve by tuning its funding cycle configurations over time to calibrate incentives and investments. Specifically, a project has a <code>funding target</code>, <code>funding cycle duration</code>, a <code>reserved rate</code>, a <code>bonding curve rate</code>, and a <code>discount rate</code> at its disposal. Changes to these are made over time with the approval of a ballot contract that can be implemented with whatever governance/representation structure a project and its community want.</p><p>The <code>funding target</code> determines how much money a project can withdraw during each funding cycle, the length of which is determined by its <code>funding cycle duration</code>. </p><p>Each payment made to a project mints and distributes the project's tokens for the payer, and allocates a reserved percentage (<code>reserved rate</code>) of tokens for a set of addresses preprogrammed by the project owner. The total amount of tokens that get minted as a result of a payment is influenced by its configured <code>discount rate</code>s over time, which incentivizes earlier contributors who naturally are assuming more a bit more risk. All funds that are received by a project that exceed its <code>funding target</code> are considered overflow. This overflow serves both as the project's runway and its community's treasury. Each token holder has an option over this overflow that they can exercise by redeeming (burning) their tokens. </p><p>The project can configure a <code>bonding curve rate</code> that affects how much overflow each token can claim – a rate of 100% allows X% of tokens to be redeemable for X% of overflow, whereas one of 50% allows X% of tokens to be redeemable for about (0.5 * X)%, leaving the rest to share between their token hodlers.</p><p>Lastly, a project can mint a supply of premined tokens if it hasn't yet configured a funding cycle or received a payment. </p><p>Look through <a href="https://juicebox.money" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">juicebox.money</a>, <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/dHsQ7Bt3ryXbZ2sRBAfBq5/Fluid-Dynamics?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">visual technical docs</a>, and other blog posts for a more in depth primer of these controls 🎛.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="scenarios">Scenarios<a class="hash-link" href="#scenarios" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Back to the original question: how might big money involve themselves in Juicebox projects?</p><p>The answer is to just stick money in the protocol for the specific project. The system works the same for everyone. </p><p>Let's play out an example to see what might happen if someone wanted to dump an investment into the <a href="https://juicebox.money/#/p/juicebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JuiceboxDAO</a>.
<img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image-9-c6caf1f83ae64fc0798f3a263beb9431.png" width="2000" height="1171" class="img_ev3q">JuiceboxDAO from Jango's perspective at the time of this writing
Let's say someone parks $1 million here. My screen would then look more like this.
<img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/Frame-1-6-7a45c8316bd7a56c10a36add3dc43a34.png" width="2000" height="1162" class="img_ev3q">JuiceboxDAO from Jango's perspective after a $1 million (~434 ETH) payment.
Here's what changed:</p><ol><li>There is more overflow.</li><li>More tokens got minted, 10% of which were allocated for distribution to the reserved token recipients.</li><li>The newly minted tokens were added to the total supply, which decreased my JBX ownership percent from 42% to 5.9%.
Not pictured: the payer now owns 71% of JBX supply.</li><li>The payment would feature on the activity feed.</li></ol><p>Facts about this new state we would find ourselves in:</p><ul><li>The project's treasury now has more money to work with, which can represent a longer runway (more time) or an opportunity for larger and more diverse payouts/investments (more impact).</li><li>With a bonding curve of 60%, the payer could redeem their 71% of tickets right away for about $644,000 (280 ETH). This amount would increase as payments are made to the project at different discount rates over time, or if other holders decide to redeem their tickets ahead of the payer. However, this amount will decrease if the project burns through funding cycles at a faster rate than overflow grows.
<a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/sp9ru6zbpk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heres a tool</a> to model the Juicebox bonding curve. <code>o</code> is the current amount of overflow, <code>s</code> is the currently total supply of tokens, and <code>r</code> is the bonding curve. The <code>x-axis</code> is the amount of tokens being redeemed, and the <code>y-axis</code> is the amount of overflow that can be claimed by redeeming the <code>x-axis</code> amount.</li><li>The payer has an outsized majority of tokens (71%). If JuiceboxDAO uses a funding cycle ballot that is decided with a simple majority and relies only on JBX ownership for representation, the decision will hinge on the point-of-view of the payer. Ballots can be designed to avoid this, but it also kind of makes sense that any revised configurations that might allocate the $1 million would have to be approved by the person who contributed the $1 million. </li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="strategy">Strategy<a class="hash-link" href="#strategy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>If you're a whale, I think you want to bet on the Juicebox ecosystem as a whole more-so than any one particular project. Everything will have more value if several promising ideas are turning into funded project's playing within the Juicebox configuration design space to grow their communities.</p><p>A project can configure Juicebox is many ways. A project with a 0% discount rate, 10% bonding curve, a 10% reserved rate, and a 50 ETH funding target proposes a very different game from a project with a 20% discount rate, 100% bonding curve, 50% reserved rate, and 10 ETH funding target. Lots of interesting configurations are possible within these gradients, and there's no way for a project to know what the best one will be ahead of time. There's hardly any precedent or data to make decisions from yet, so each project/community gets to experiment and find something that is efficient for its needs. </p><p>As an investor, this is grounds for high risk experimentation. If you think a project is promising and want to give it $1 million, you should probably:</p><ul><li>be aware of its configured reserved rate. </li><li>get a feel for the project's discount rate and how it has changed since the project's launch. This will help inform you of how your token balance will compare to the total token supply.</li><li>understand the project's bonding curve rate to get a feel for how liquid your position will be. </li><li>know how the project has configured its funding cycle ballot, which determines who holds the power to enact new funding cycle configurations (rug pulls totally possible). </li></ul><p>All of this is also true for apes 🦧, but they probably put money in before reading this.</p><p>Punks 👾 get to build culture and communities on top of a transparent web of interdependent people and projects getting paid what they are able to ask for.</p><p>Creators 🎨 and devs ⌨️ get to work on the projects they like, or instead launch their own. They get paid what they are able to ask for from their communities.</p><p>Every Etherean 🇪🇹 essentially gets paid as they transact through web3 protocols and (unintentionally) contribute to the growth of that protocol's project's community's treasury at that particular point in time.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts<a class="hash-link" href="#closing-thoughts" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>If someone contributed a fat stash into the JuiceboxDAO treasury right now and we were to expand the monthly target to accommodate more spending, I can think of many many things for us to allocate funds toward. For one, we could pay someone to help us write searchable, understandable, and inviting technical docs. We could also pay someone to help us write docs. I think we should even consider paying someone a respectable payout to come onboard to write docs.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Juicebox contracts were deployed to Ethereum two days ago. Yesterday, <a href="https://twitter.com/peripheralist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@peripheralist</a>, who built the <a href="http://juicebox.money" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">juicebox.money</a> website, launched a generative art project called Tiles using the Juicebox protocol as its treasury, <a href="http://tiles.art" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://tiles.art</a>. He started a DAO around it, <a href="https://discord.gg/bgGwmjWJ85" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://discord.gg/bgGwmjWJ85</a>. </p><p>With Juicebox, we had built a business-model protocol. With Tiles, he built a beautiful, expressive, and flexible collection of generative art to rally a community around. Neither of us had much of an idea what would or should happen next, but I was excited to take a step back and find out.</p><p>My conclusion: From a growth perspective, we can either go out and look for more entrepreneurs and artists that could benefit from using Juicebox, or we can lean into TileDAO since it's the one project that currently uses Juicebox. Since <code>building stuff &gt; shilling stuff</code> is an invariant for me, I think the best thing I can do right now as a $JBX token holder is to participate in TileDAO and help grow it. As other projects start considering building on Juicebox, our job will be to become supporting cast member of their community also.</p>]]></content>

Project owners can re-asses their funding needs and cycle configuration over time, and can choose to take their token holders' perspectives into account while publishing these sorts of changes to Juicebox.</p><hr><p>There are several ways to configure your Juicebox projects. Here are few cool things you can do:</p><ol><li>You can route your income stream through the Juicebox contracts.</li></ol><p>For example, you can make a version of Uniswap that explicitly only needs <strong>$X</strong> per month to be sustainably run (labor, ops), where each swap transaction incurs a fee <strong>($Y)</strong> that goes towards sustaining the service. If there are enough swaps that month <strong>(N)</strong> such that <strong>N * $Y &gt; $X</strong>, then for each subsequent swap, all accounts that have swapped (and therefor paid fees) receive a dividend from the overflowed revenue that is proportional to the amount they've contributed to the project's sustainability thus far. So if <strong>N * $Y</strong> grows unjustifiably faster than <strong>$X</strong> — which is the underlying market rent-seeking inefficiency that Juicebox projects try to out-compete — then instead of compounded shareholder wealth aggregation, everyone's price tends towards zero.</p><p>Meaning people get a nearly-free, community-driven product with no ads, guaranteed data integrity, full business operation accountability, and an open source code base that runs reliably. All built by motivated punks that are getting paid what they ask for and are rewarded alongside the community as overflow grows.
2. It's easy to program financial dependencies, so your Juicebox project's funding target can be contractually hooked up to those of people and projects it depends on.
3. You can run a recurring/one-time fundraising campaign and return extra funds to your community, or to other causes.
4. As the project owner, you can earn some of your own tokens with every payment you receives. You'll "unlock" these tokens at the rate with which your overflow grows, not according to some arbitrary multi-year vesting schedule. These reserved tokens can then be contractually distributed to staff, or to other causes.</p><hr><p>There's nothing more exciting than working on/with/for the Ethereum ecosystem these days – new artful minds are being welcomed into cryptowallet-life everyday, and brilliant experiments are being crafted on the regular. It's a creator's dream – there's no need to manage infrastructure, &nbsp;growth is driven by your community, and financial expectations can be anchored down by code. The Juicebox protocol was created as a means to further this end. </p><p>If you have questions or want to contribute, don't hesitate to <a href="https://discord.gg/6jXrJSyDFf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hop into the Discord</a>.</p>]]></content>
