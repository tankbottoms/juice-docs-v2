I had first learned about DAOs a few years ago but never really understood what they did or how they got things done.  How do DAOs coordinate? How do they align their philosophy?  How did they keep each other accountable?  All of these questions were very difficult for me to wrap my head around. I then stumbled upon JB after finding out about the NOUNS project and then finding SharkDao which was using Juicebox for its treasury.</p><p>What I talked about with this JB community member was the fact that I didn&#x27;t say a word in Juicebox for 2 - 3 weeks.  I attended a couple of town hall meetings and listened in on some voice chats that were happening, not knowing what the agenda was or what they were going to be talking about.  I remember reading a bunch of  threads in Discord, trying to follow one or two specific issues, to see how the community tried to solve them.  What became clear was that it was important for me to not try to understand what a few people were doing, but to try and understand what the community was doing.  That was an epiphany for me.  It made me ask, &quot;where do this community&#x27;s values and my personal beliefs and ethics intersect?&quot;</p><p>This was the moment I started to look for tasks that helped me align myself with the community philosophy.  I started to shift my mindset from a quiet observer to thinking about how I could provide value that  could help advance the protocol and in turn, the Juicebox Community.  As I was exploring, I realized that I was also learning how to navigate the community.  How to navigate the notion, the web site, the Discord and everything else that might go along with JB.</p><p>To those wanting to become Juicebox contributors: follow a couple of tasks or issues and see how those issues are being solved by the community.  Then see if those solutions line up with how you might handle those issues. <strong>That doesn&#x27;t mean you have to agree.</strong>  It just means that how we talk to each other and how we interact with each other lines up with how you want to talk to people and how you want to be talked to.</p><p>If you start this way, not only will you find a way to contribute but you will see that the Juicebox community will help you contribute.  You&#x27;ll see that Juicebox will view you not just as someone that has a valuable skill but someone that has a philosophy that aligns with the goals of the Juicebox community.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/dao">dao</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/guide">guide</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/state-of-jbx">Observations: State of JBX</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-12-07T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">December 7, 2021</time> · <!-- -->6 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/me_jango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1414958948189413395/l89bNR2m_400x400.jpg" alt="Jango"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/me_jango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Jango</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">JuiceboxDAO Contributor</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>JuiceboxDAO runs its community treasury on the Juicebox protocol.

This rate currently decreases by 10% every other week. There is a proposal to push this up to 20%.</p><p>At the current redemption bonding curve of 60%, the protocol is offering 1 ETH back from the treasury for each <strong>679,652 JBX </strong>burned. There is a proposal to change this rate to 95%, at which the protocol would be offering 1 ETH for about <strong>459,219 JBX</strong> burned.</p><p>The price of JBX / ETH on Uniswap is currently <strong>446,380 JBX</strong> per 1 ETH traded.</p><p>JuiceboxDAO currently has a reserved rate of 35%, which means 112,495 new JBX get reserved per ETH contributed to the treasury alongside the amount issued for the contributor. 30% of this goes to the DAO (dao.jbx.eth), 24% to jango.eth, 24% to peri.eth, 7% to nnnnicholas.eth, 7% to exekias.eth, 4% to CanuDAO, and 4% to WAGMI Studios. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="observations">Observations<a class="hash-link" href="#observations" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>JBX is currently trading in between the issuance and the burn rates on off-protocol markets such as the Uniswap AMM. There&#x27;s currently no incentive for anyone to inflate or shrink the JBX supply.</li></ul><p>The protocol says nothing about what might happen off-protocol. The following are just my assumptions and not financial advice.  </p><ul><li>If the market price of JBX increases past the protocol&#x27;s issuance price, any additional demand of JBX can be fulfilled by contributing ETH to the Juicebox treasury which will in turn mint and distribute JBX.</li></ul><p>Risk taking arbitragers might be incentivized to mint extra JBX at this funding cycle&#x27;s rate to cover the 10% spread that will become available when the cycle rolls over and the discount takes effect. They can also benefit from information asymmetry by minting JBX to fill buy orders on off-protocol markets – <em>the JuiceboxDAO community should work to minimize the opportunity for information asymmetry</em>.</p><p>Either of these will benefit all JBX holders who have held their JBX from better rates during previous funding cycles – their share of the total JBX in circulation will shrink, but the ETH treasury that backs each JBX will grow at a faster rate, which has the effect of increasing the burn rate.</p><ul><li>If the price of JBX decreases past the protocol&#x27;s burn rate, further demand to sell JBX can be fulfilled by burning JBX to get ETH that is locked in the treasury&#x27;s overflow.</li></ul><p>Again, arbitragers can benefit from information asymmetry by burning JBX to fill sell orders on off-protocol markets – <em>again, the JuiceboxDAO community should work to minimize the opportunity for information asymmetry. </em></p><p>Either of these will benefit all JBX holders who chose to hold their JBX through the sell pressure – every JBX that is redeemed at a redemption bonding curve leaves some ETH on the table from its proportional share (60% curve leaves a lot more on the table for holders than a 95% curve, exaggerating the effect). In all cases except a 100% redemption curve, the JBX circulating supply will be decreasing at a faster rate than the treasury&#x27;s ETH supply. This will marginally increase the burn rate for JBX with each subsequent burn, which will add upward pressure on prices, shrink supply, and leave only the holders that turned away the potentially mounting exit incentive to keep building. </p><ul><li>Over time as the market pushes against the issue and burn rates, a JBX holder&#x27;s burn rate will increase and might eventually exceed the value that the JBX was minted at. </li></ul><p>The more pressure on either side, the more the burn rate increases for each holder. On the other hand, the burn rate will stay the same if the market is being satisfied off protocol.</p><p>Tail market events benefit JBX holders most, albeit in a contained and measured way. The only thing that does not benefit JBX holders is the lack of change in JBX demand over time. Under this mechanism, it seems we are sacrificing price swings for resiliency.</p><ul><li>The DAO is spending ETH each funding cycle to pay out contributors, services, and grants as proposals get approved by JBX holders. The impact of this spending is spread across all JBX holders, marginally reducing everyone&#x27;s burn rate. </li></ul><p>The DAO could also allocate ETH off-platform in its multisig wallet or various other contracts across web3. This value is currently impossible to account for in the burn rate given the current version of the Juicebox protocol.</p><ul><li><p>The reserved token list only captures value when the token supply is growing. Once token supply has expanded and the market is satisfied off protocol, reserved token holders are massively incentivized to push the price up towards its limit. </p></li><li><p>It is expensive to mint 51% of all tokens in existence, even without a reserved rate. If this were to happen, the ETH used to mint the token majority would immediately fund an increased burn rate for every token holder from previous cycles. The new influential JBX holder would have to appease a community with potentially significant exit incentive.</p></li></ul><p>This same effect exists if the 51% is bought all-of-the-sudden by thousands of uncoordinated people on the internet.</p><ul><li>The DAO (dao.jbx.eth) currently receives 30% of reserved JBX tokens. The DAO is considering committing a percent of this built up supply to circulate among contributors via the DAO&#x27;s discord. </li></ul><p>It can do so in many ways, one approach is to split the allocation among the addresses on the reserved list, who are then encouraged to split this initial supply entirely between those who they work closest with and who&#x27;s contributions they want to recognize. Those recipients are in turn encouraged to continue circulating this supply. </p><p>The goal is to make sure everyone who is building and maintaining the protocol and ecosystem becomes significant JBX token holders that can formally help the DAO make decisions.</p><p>If this internal JBX distribution system increases the governance participation of new builders and of those who steward the protocol, then the DAO may benefit from expanding this program by increasing the portion of reserved tokens allocated to the DAO treasury, and reducing the reserved token allocation to other recipients.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/observations">observations</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/dao-tooling-101">DAO Tooling 101</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-12-06T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">December 6, 2021</time> · <!-- -->7 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/aeolianeth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1510052173073510401/14_Uoxzy_400x400.jpg" alt="Aeolian"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/aeolianeth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aeolian</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Peel Contributor</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Entering the world of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) is kind of like opening the gates to Narnia: it&#x27;s thrilling, it&#x27;s confusing, and because real money is involved, it&#x27;s somewhat scary.</p><p>Late 2021 appears to be the frontier of DAOs, and best practices and playbooks for starting and governing DAOs are being written as I write this.</p><p>In particular, the DAO stack - the set of software tools required to run a DAO - is beginning to mature. One such example is Juicebox - a DAO treasury protocol - which was recently picked by the <a href="https://juicebox.money/#/p/constitutiondao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ConstitutionDAO</a> to raise almost ~47million USD in an attempt to buy a copy of the United States Constitution.</p><p>In this article, we&#x27;ll define the fundamental functions of a DAO and describe the tools required to fulfill these functions.

We&#x27;ll talk about DAOs as they are being used today in the crypto/NFT world. In this world, a DAO has 2 main functions:</p><ol><li>Building a treasury of assets (NFTs, Ethereum (ETH), or some other token)</li><li>Governing the treasury</li></ol><p>Let&#x27;s say your favorite podcaster decides to set up a DAO for their podcast. They need assets (read: money) to keep the podcast going and do bigger and better things like merch and in-person events. So, they need a way to build a treasury of assets. They&#x27;ll issue an ERC20 token (let&#x27;s call this token <code>$PODC</code>), and anyone who contributes funds to the treasury will receive <code>$PODC</code> token in exchange. You, the listener, believe in this podcaster and want to be a part of their success. So you buy some <code>$PODC</code> token and contribute to the treasury.</p><p>As a <code>$PODC</code> token holder, you have perks. You can propose changes to the podcast format and make guest proposals, and you can also vote on other proposals. You and the other token holders now have skin in the game - or skin in the podcast - and have a meaningful impact on the podcast and its success. The DAO can be creative here, too. Holding a token might grant you access to a private discord, private meetings, or airdrops. In a successful DAO, the DAO may vote to distribute excess funds to token holders.</p><p>Don&#x27;t like what the DAO is doing? No worries! Your tokens are 100% backed by the treasury, meaning you can sell your token back to the DAO and receive your original investment (less gas and other fees).</p><p>An attractive characteristic of a DAO when compared to a traditional private company is transparency. Every aspect of the DAO is available on and verified by, the blockchain. Any eager individual can observe the flow of assets and call out dodgy activity. Importantly, no accountants or lawyers are required!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-dao-stack"><strong>The DAO stack</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#the-dao-stack" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>To achieve the 2 functions of a DAO, we&#x27;re going to need some tools. Luckily, smart folks are putting in the leg work and the DAO stack is maturing rapidly. Below, we&#x27;ll discuss Juicebox, Gnosis, Snapshot, and Aragon - 4 key tools in the DAO stack - and how they fit together to form a DAO.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="juicebox"><strong>Juicebox</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#juicebox" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The <a href="https://juicebox.money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicebox</a> protocol is a programmable treasury. In practice, you can think of Juicebox as a decentralized alternative to Kickstarter; a way to raise funds on the blockchain. It fulfills the first function of the DAO: building the treasury. Technically speaking, Juicebox is a <a href="https://github.com/jbx-protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">set of smart contracts</a> deployed on the Ethereum blockchain that handles the issuance of tokens and the building of the treasury.</p><p>In our podcast DAO example, the podcaster would create a Juicebox project. They can define various parameters that dictate how the project will operate, like funding targets, the exchange rate, payouts, and the number of tokens reserved for founders. The Juicebox project has an associated token: <code>$PODC</code>. To contribute to the podcast DAO&#x27;s treasury, I would head to the project&#x27;s page on <a href="https://juicebox.money" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://juicebox.money</a>, connect my Metamask wallet and contribute ETH. In exchange, I would get some <code>$PODC</code> token based on the Juicebox project&#x27;s predefined exchange rate.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="gnosis"><strong>Gnosis</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#gnosis" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Who &quot;owns&quot; the treasury? A single person <em>could</em> own the treasury, but nothing is stopping them from running off with the bag besides reputational risk.</p><p>Enter: the multi-signature wallet, commonly known as a &quot;multisig&quot;. A multisig is fundamentally a contract that can hold assets and execute transactions, with one exception: it requires the signature of <em>more than one</em> address to execute transactions. Just like a business where you need multiple signatures to do anything, a multisig requires some number of signatures (typically <code>m</code> of <code>n</code>, say, 2 signatures out of 3 signatories) to execute a given transaction.</p><p>So, when setting up the podcast DAO, we would create a multisig between the podcast founders (say, the 2 podcasts hosts and any other significant contributors). The multisig would be the owner of the Juicebox project. This allows us to have multiple individuals controlling the parameters for fundraising so that no individual can go rogue.</p><p><a href="https://gnosis-safe.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gnosis</a> is the go-to tool for creating and managing multisigs. It provides a clean and simple UI to enable the management of a multisig. Signatories connect their Metamask wallet and can approve and reject transactions from Gnosis.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="snapshot"><strong>Snapshot</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#snapshot" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>How do you vote with your DAO tokens? <a href="https://Snapshot.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snapshot.org</a>! Snapshot is an off-chain voting tool used to propose and vote on changes to the DAO. It leverages IPFS to store votes.</p><p>A proposal is just a document that lays out some change to the DAO and gives a single choice amongst multiple options in a voting mechanism. Anybody holding the DAO&#x27;s token can vote on a proposal for which result they prefer. For example, someone might create a proposal on Snapshot that a certain person is interviewed as a guest on the podcast. As a <code>$PODC</code> holder, I can navigate to the proposal on <a href="http://Snapshot.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snapshot.org</a> and vote yes or no. The weighting of my vote is proportional to the amount of <code>$PODC</code> I hold.</p><p>A proposal is accepted by the DAO when a certain number of votes is reached (say, two-thirds, or 67%). When a proposal is accepted, it is the responsibility of the multisig signatories to carry out the proposal.</p><p>Importantly, there is an element of trust required for this to work effectively. At the end of the day, the multisig signatories have complete control over the treasury, and they have to be willing to carry out the wishes of the DAO. This risk is mitigated by the nature of the multisig: because it requires multiple signatures, the likelihood of coordination amongst bad-acting signatories is somewhat mitigated. Reputation is on the line, too, so signatories are somewhat incentivized to act in the best interest of the DAO.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="aragon"><strong>Aragon</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#aragon" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>As noted above, Snapshot voting happens off-chain, but on-chain voting is possible. In comparison, <a href="https://aragon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aragon</a> provides on-chain voting. With Aragon, no aspect of the DAO is happening in your web browser. Instead, absolutely everything would be executed as a transaction on the blockchain. In some sense, this makes the DAO more decentralized, but also a little bit less agile and quite a bit more expensive to interact with.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="takeaways"><strong>Takeaways</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#takeaways" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>DAOs are becoming more and more popular, and there is no single playbook for creating a DAO. We are in an ecosystem of DAO tooling. Juicebox, Gnosis, Snapshot, Aragon are composable tools that can be mixed and matched with each other to create the infrastructure that is a single DAO. Each DAO will make different choices about which pieces of tooling and what level of decentralization is appropriate for their project and goals.</p><hr><p>Follow [<a href="https://twitter.com/aeolianeth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@aeolianeth</a>] on Twitter.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/ecosystem">ecosystem</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/guide">guide</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/juicebox-protocol-tokenomics">Juicebox protocol tokenomics</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-11-27T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">November 27, 2021</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/me_jango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1414958948189413395/l89bNR2m_400x400.jpg" alt="Jango"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/me_jango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Jango</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">JuiceboxDAO Contributor</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>In its first funding cycle, each project issues 1,000,000 tokens for each 1 ETH received.</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="level-0">Level 0<a class="hash-link" href="#level-0" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In its simplest form, a Juicebox project can be configured to fundraise and provide refunds. </p><p>Example: I pay 5 ETH into a treasury and receive 5,000,000 tokens, and you pay 5 ETH and receive 5,000,000 tokens. There are now 10 ETH in the treasury and 10,000,000 tokens total. Since I own half of the tokens, I can redeem them to get half of the treasury&#x27;s total – in other words I can get a refund. You can do the same.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="level-1">Level 1<a class="hash-link" href="#level-1" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A reserved rate can be added which will allocate a percentage of the minted token supply to a preprogrammed list of addresses.</p><p>Example: The project sets a 10% reserved rate that goes to the DAO&#x27;s multisig address. I pay 5 ETH into a treasury and receive 4,500,000 tokens, and you pay 5 ETH and receive 4,500,000 tokens. The DAO&#x27;s multisig now has access to 1,000,000 tokens. Because of the reserved rate, I can no longer redeem my tokens to get a refund – I will only get 90% of what I paid. </p><p>At a reserved rate of 100%, no tokens go to new contributors.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="level-2">Level 2<a class="hash-link" href="#level-2" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A funding cycle target can be set which blocks off some funds from the treasury that can be distributed by anyone to a set of preprogrammed addresses.</p><p>Example: The project sets a target of 1 ETH. I pay 5 ETH into a treasury and receive 5,000,000 tokens, and you pay 5 ETH and receive 5,000,000 tokens.
The treasury now has 10 ETH –  1 ETH is within the target, and the other 9 are considered overflow. I can redeem/burn by tokens to receive my proportion of the overflow, which is 4.5 ETH. The 1 ETH target is still distributable to the project and not accessible to token holders.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="level-3">Level 3<a class="hash-link" href="#level-3" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A redemption bonding curve can be added which reduces the amount of the treasury that can be reclaimed by redeeming tokens. </p><p>Example: The project sets a 50% bonding curve. I pay 5 ETH to the treasury and receive 5,000,000 tokens, and you pay 5 ETH and receive 5,000,000 tokens. Because of the redemption bonding curve, I will only receive ~2.5 ETH if I redeem my tokens. The rest is left to share by those who are holding, so you could now redeem your tokens and get the remaining ~7.5 ETH.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="level-4">Level 4<a class="hash-link" href="#level-4" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A discount rate can be added to decrease the rate of tokens that are minted and distributed when contributions are received over time. </p><p>Example: The project sets a 10% discount rate and a 14 day funding cycle duration.  I pay 5 ETH to the treasury and receive 5,000,000 tokens on day one during the first funding cycle. Fourteen days later during the second funding cycle, you pay 5 ETH and receive 4,500,000 tokens.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="level-5">Level 5<a class="hash-link" href="#level-5" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>It is important to note that a project can change its reserved rate, target, redemption bonding curve, and discount rate on a per-funding cycle basis. Some projects might choose to have no funding cycle duration for the most flexibility, meaning they can reconfigure the project on demand. It is really important to trust the owner of the project because they have a lot of control to shape the tokenomics. </p><p>A project can also set a ballot contract in its funding cycle to create conditions according to which all proposed reconfigurations must abide.</p><p>Example: The project sets a 3-day delay ballot contract. If the project owner wants to reconfigure any funding cycle property, the transaction to do so must be sent at least 3 days before the end of the current funding cycle. If the reconfiguration was made within the 3 days, the next funding cycle will instead be a copy of the current one, and the reconfiguration would be eligible to take effect after that one.</p><p>People can build arbitrary ballot contracts as long as it conforms to <a href="https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v1/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IFundingCycleBallot.sol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IFundingCycleBallot</a>.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/guide">guide</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/notice-juicebox-fundraise">NOTICE: Juicebox V1 inefficiencies</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-11-27T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">November 27, 2021</time> · <!-- -->One min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/me_jango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1414958948189413395/l89bNR2m_400x400.jpg" alt="Jango"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/me_jango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Jango</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">JuiceboxDAO Contributor</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Before you start a project on Juicebox V1 or contribute funds to one, understand the following inefficiencies.

3. There is no direct burn transaction, but tokens will be burnt when redeemed. Therefor in order to burn, reconfigure your target such that there is overflow, then redeem tokens and then inject the overflow back into the treasury.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/protocol">protocol</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/observations">observations</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/cross-layer-juicebox-pt-2">Cross-layer Juicebox protocol: follow up #1</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-11-24T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">November 24, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/me_jango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1414958948189413395/l89bNR2m_400x400.jpg" alt="Jango"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/me_jango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Jango</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">JuiceboxDAO Contributor</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>From the <a href="/blog/multi-layer-juicebox/">original post</a>: </p><blockquote><p>The simplest option would be to just deploy the same Juicebox protocol in each EVM compatible L2 environment.

I&#x27;m guessing most projects would prefer to operate everywhere, if only it were easy to do so.</p></blockquote><p>What if the simplest option was the best option?</p><p>Although deploying the same Juicebox protocol in each EVM compatible L2 environment forces projects to choose which they would like to operate on, it might be most reasonable to pass along this choice and complexity to each project while suggesting thorough operational strategies to weave these isolated environments together at the DAO/social/governance layer.</p><p>Here are some potential operational guidelines, using JuiceboxDAO as an example:</p><ul><li>Juicebox protocol is deployed identically on several L2s and side chains. JuiceboxDAO creates a project on each one where fees will be collected and contributions accepted.</li><li>JuiceboxDAO will have different tokens on each chain. JuiceboxDAO membership is composed of a strategy that take each of these tokens into account. Members are responsible for managing the entirety of the DAO&#x27;s treasury across all chains.</li><li>JuiceboxDAO submits treasury reconfigurations to each chain independently. Each chain can have funding cycles that operate on different schedules, have different token issuance rates, and different ETH distributions. This flexibility can be used to orchestrate arbitrary multi-chain treasury designs, although also introducing management overhead. Extend to new environments responsibly.</li><li>JuiceboxDAO can move its ETH/tokens between environments adhering to the constraints of each chain, leaning on existing and upcoming generalized bridging infrastructure.</li><li>It can deploy converter contracts if it wishes to support conversions between each of its membership tokens.</li></ul><p>Any other project could choose to operate on one or many environments where the Juicebox protocol has been deployed. If they choose to operate on many, they would have to manage the complexity of doing so. Once projects have begun experimenting and settling on effective patterns, I&#x27;d hope a playbook would emerge as a reference for future projects.</p><p>Leaving multi-layer coordination for the social layer introduces some operational overhead and risk, but also keeps the protocol layer flexible and simple.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/protocol">protocol</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/observations">observations</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/multi-layer-juicebox">Cross-layer Juicebox Protocol</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-11-22T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">November 22, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/me_jango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1414958948189413395/l89bNR2m_400x400.jpg" alt="Jango"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/me_jango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Jango</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">JuiceboxDAO Contributor</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Projects building on Juicebox need payment terminals that cost its contributors less gas to pay and redeem.</p><p>To do so, projects need to be able to accept funds across many different L2s alongside mainnet.</p><p>The simplest option would be to just deploy the same Juicebox protocol in each EVM compatible L2 environment.
