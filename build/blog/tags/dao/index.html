Not all communities are created equal, and many of them struggle to find their footing in the hustle and bustle of web3.</p><p>Finding good community members isn’t easy, but keeping them in the long run can be even harder. If your DAO has no way to compensate good community members or suffers from lack of coordinate or mission-alignment issues, you will likely find qualified people sticking around briefly and moving on. Consider thinking carefully about your mission and about a way to make it enthralling for new members. Sell the idea, and show how that idea will benefit your contributors or the planet at large. Don’t be afraid to say no, and have your mission well thought-out before you open a discord and start trying to attract new members.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="decide-on-governance-that-works-now">Decide on governance that works NOW<a class="hash-link" href="#decide-on-governance-that-works-now" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Many different <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/great-web3-governance-at-a-glance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">governance</a> systems exist, including 1-member-1-vote, quadratic voting, voting-by-tokens-held, and many more. Think carefully about how you’d like your own DAO to operate. Do you want everyone to have equal participation and inclusion? Then perhaps one-member-one-vote is the way to go. Or do you want certain members to have voting power because they are part of a core group? Do you want votes to pass with a 51% majority, or higher?</p><p>These are all important questions to consider. If you want a DAO that is more resistant to change, you may consider putting a voting threshold very high, for instance around 75% or above. This would ensure that only when the vast majority of your members agree on something that it will change.</p><p>If you want your DAO to morph quickly with changing times, you may decide to drop your voting threshold lower than 50%. This can also open you open to having your DAO hijacked by an influx of new members, so beware!</p><p>Regarding votes, how do you want people’s voting power to be represented? If you want to vote by tokens-held, then you are effectively allowing the wealthy to have greater voting power than the less wealthy. There is an argument here that the wealthy, who have invested the most in your project, deserve more voting power because they have more to lose. But new members entering your project may feel like voting is futile if they are eclipsed by others with outized voting power.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dont-be-afraid-to-adapt-as-you-scale-up">Don’t be afraid to adapt as you scale up<a class="hash-link" href="#dont-be-afraid-to-adapt-as-you-scale-up" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Consider what system you need right now, and be open to changing it. Regarding governance: If you are a small community with a core team, you may say that one-member-one-vote is the way to go. Do what makes sense at the time. If your project grows and you see another voting mechanism being more fruitful, go through the motions and suggest a change. Voting mechanisms are not set in stone, and shouldn’t be. Your DAO needs to adapt with the changing circumstances it finds itself in.</p><p>Regarding your discord server, Telegram or other service, consider changing it as your needs change. If your discord channels end up getting outdated, don’t be afraid to archive them. If your new members are getting lost in the onboarding process, consider adapting your process to be more open to new faces. Remember that by the time you start to grow, your DAO will be something you start to understand much more easily than a new member just coming in. It’s easy to lose sight of that perspective, so keep in mind to keep it simple and direct.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="and-most-importantly">And most importantly…<a class="hash-link" href="#and-most-importantly" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Have fun! You are engaging in something new, and in a great human experiment! Issues around governance have plagued humanity for thousands of years, and now with the advent of blockchain technology we have yet another style of governance to play with.

For thousands of years civilizations have attempted to crack this pesky conundrum, and arguably we’ve gotten a bit better at it. But has anyone truly solved governance? When we look at the instability in our history, it’s hard to say we have.</p><p>With blockchain and decentralization, a new movement has emerged to try to demonstrate what proper governance can look like. The <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/daolicious-tips-for-starting-your-first-dao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DAO</a>, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is one of many new attempts to organize human beings in a way that is conducive to efficiently and happiness. <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/the-power-of-tokenomics-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tokenomics</a>— a unique staple in web3 organizations— potentially hold the power to reinvent governance as we know it. So what’s the best system?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="community-as-the-core-of-great-governance">Community as the core of great governance<a class="hash-link" href="#community-as-the-core-of-great-governance" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The short answer is: we don’t know. There are still total intangibles to governance that seem to elude our planning. Let’s take a look at the United States’ governance as an example.</p><p>Many people will point to the United States, a representative democracy, as an example of an effective governance system. Consider, however, that early on in the forming of that government, the first president, George Washington, was given free reign to control the government as he saw fit. He could have declared himself a king, and in fact it was his completely voluntary precedents that determined much of how the government matured in subsequent years.</p><p>Most people would agree that this kind of noble behavior is what shaped the United States toward democracy, and that Washington single-handedly could have given himself supreme power but chose not to. So this begs the question: how do we find the George Washington’s in web3? Where are the builders who will willingly take a back seat to allow an organization to grow?</p><p>And this is where community comes into play. A strong community with shared values and interests is one way to ensure that your members will look out for one another. George Washington has just gone through a war, and was thinking of what great sacrifices took place so that this new government could form. He was surrounded by soldiers and generals and statesmen who had gone through something similar. His incentive was to improve community, not hijack it.</p><p>What does the web3 analogue look like? That’s hard to say. A quick look at some of <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/juicebox-the-token-minting-powerhouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicebox</a>’s governance systems will show why we believe that are some tangibles, however, that can point you in the right direction.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="transparency-is-key">Transparency is key<a class="hash-link" href="#transparency-is-key" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>web3 is paradoxical in more ways than one. Perhaps at its core, however, is the idea that transparency is key. No backdoor deals, and everything can can be audited if one wishes.</p><p>This system dovetails with the themes of trustlessness we see all over blockchain discussions. If I’m regularly doing backroom deals, in the traditional world I would need your trust to let me keep doing that. How do you know I’m not abusing that trust? You don’t. In the web3 world, I have to have my dealings out in the open. Now, I don’t care if you trust me or not, because you can freely look at what I’m doing and, if it’s inappropriate, you can simple call attention to that.</p><p>Does this always work? No, of course not. But does it go a far way to establishing a shared value system? Yes. If everything is open, including payout distributions, proposals for how to change something, or partnership deals, then likely everyone will be on the same page about it. It also gives opportunity for structured disagreements, where hard questions can be asked.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bringing-it-all-together">Bringing it all together<a class="hash-link" href="#bringing-it-all-together" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>If anybody promises you that they have a system for finding the “George Washingtons” in your governance, run the other way. There is no sure-fire way to find the intangibles. What you can do, however, is structure your governance in a way that scares away the bad actors. Remember that your fifth columns only work when there are shadows, concealment, and graft at play. When you shine a bright light on everything, suddenly the environment is less conducive to trickery and value-misalignment (whether pernicious or well-intentioned). Keep that light shining bright, and don’t be afraid to speak your mind. You owe it to yourself and to your governance-compatriots.</p><p>Want more?

I can’t wait to get started on my accounting!” We get it. You have a passion, and it’s probably not in making an accounts payable/receivable department.</p><p>But here’s the thing: how your <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/daolicious-tips-for-starting-your-first-dao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DAO</a>, business or non-profit treats its capital is <em>absolutely</em> an essential factor to its long-term success.

That’s what the Juicebox programmable treasury delivers. It allows you to easily set payouts, determine where new funds go, how they are connected to tokens which, by the way, are also minted at your discretion. It puts all that power in your hands, without asking you to take on another full-time job, or pay out another full-time salary, saving you capital when you need it most.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="keeping-your-passion-where-it-belongs">Keeping your passion where it belongs<a class="hash-link" href="#keeping-your-passion-where-it-belongs" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The Juicebox programmable treasury comes with a full suite of tooling that is easy to use and implement.

Starting a web3 business and you need to track your accounts payable/receivable? Juicebox can do that. Starting a nonprofit where you want to reward members with tokens for governance and participation? Juicebox can do that, too. Don’t quite know what you want to create, but you know you want a project that executes on-chain and has more tooling than anybody else in the game? Juicebox has you covered.</p><p>There are few web3 platforms out there that can help you create your own project and DAO, but none of them can do it with the ease and tooling that Juicebox can. Juicebox provides users with a platform to raise money, either as a one-time or on a recurring basis, all while also offering a suit of tokenomics tooling and token minting. If you don’t want tokens, no problem, you can use Juicebox like a simple programmable treasury to track donations, payments, profits (or “overflow” as you’ll come to learn), in a transparent and honest way. The days of opaque bookkeeping where contributors have to wonder exactly how their donations are spent are over.</p><p>Juicebox can be the backbone of a local school PTA tracking funds in and out, or it can (and has!) run multi-million dollar operations. It scales effortlessly and gives you tooling to create rich token-based voting economies, as well.</p><p>Perhaps most unique is Juicebox’s approach to what it calls “overflow”, which is money raised above your target amount. This money, which otherwise may be called “profit” and traditionally may go to executive payrolls or reinvestment, sits in a treasury and can be claimed by any holders of your token. The proportional claim of the treasury a token holder receives is completely set by you using a variety of tooling, and it incentivizes anyone participating in your project to want to see its success. It’s a great way to build a mission-aligned team and, should your project find success, it’s a way to effortlessly, transparently, and efficiently reward your team members and contributors.</p><p>Want more?

Token management is an area that every builder in the web3 space should take full advantage of; unfortunately, it’s also amongst the most neglected tools by new project creators.</p><p>At <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/juicebox-the-token-minting-powerhouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicebox</a>, we’ve created a robust and granular token management system that makes token management accessible for our project creators. We’ll delve into this tooling, along with the power of tokens in general. Read on the learn more!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="governance-and-so-much-more">Governance and so much more<a class="hash-link" href="#governance-and-so-much-more" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>One crucial aspect of token minting is how they relate to governance systems within <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/dalicious-tips-for-starting-your-first-dao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DAOs</a>s. While you may or may not be creating a DAO, you should keep in mind that these very same governance systems can also be used informally to gauge your stakeholder interests in an effective and efficient way.</p><p>You can choose to give tokens at your own discretion, or set certain metrics and tokenomic tooling to automatically generate and disburse tokens based on contributions made to your project. The Juicebox difference is in the rich tooling our platform provides project creators.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-lifecycle-of-a-token-built-on-the-juicebox-protocol">The lifecycle of a token built on the Juicebox protocol<a class="hash-link" href="#the-lifecycle-of-a-token-built-on-the-juicebox-protocol" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>How a token is used within the Juicebox protocol varies on a number of different factors and project creator settings. Let’s take a look at one particular path to help give you some insight into the lifecycle of an average token.</p><p>You’ve created a project, and you’ve set a distribution limit (how much funding your project needs in a given time frame to keep the lights on). Let’s say that every two weeks your project needs to be bringing in $5,000. That amount will cover the costs of the team and any other expenses to keep your project running smoothly.</p><p>Now let’s say somebody comes along and puts $2000 into your project. In exchange for contributing those funds, they get some amount of tokens (how many is completely determined by you). Furthermore, you may want to keep some tokens every time someone contributes funds, so you set something called a <em>reserved rate</em>, which is what percentage of tokens you keep. Let’s say you do 10%. So now 10% of all tokens created goes back to your project and sits in a treasury.</p><p>Now fast forward. Many more people have contributed to your project, and at this point your distribution limit is still $5000 every two weeks, but on average you’re taking in a lot more than that. All those extra funds sit in your treasury. Those “extra” funds are called your <em>overflow</em>.</p><p>Now let’s say one of your early investors, who has a lot of tokens for your project, wants to move on and get rid of his tokens. Rather than simply ignoring them, he can claim a percent of the overflow in your treasury proportional to how many tokens he has. If he has a lot of tokens, even though he may have initially just given you $2000 in funding, his tokens could be traded in for far more than that if your overflow is sufficiently large.</p><p>What’s unique about this system is that it incentivizes contributors to your project to 1) stick around, and 2) to be actively invested in your success. Some people will never be interested in trading in tokens; they may see more utility in using the tokens for governance, or simply hanging on to them as a trophy and receipt of their contributions to you. However, for those who are hoping to eventually cash out with more than they invested, the token redeeming exchange allows for this scenario if your project has become sufficiently successful.</p><p>Let’s say that first investor burns all his tokens, and gets back $3000. He’s made a profit of one thousand dollars. By redeeming the tokens, he has taken them out of circulation and they have been destroyed. He’s made $1000 in the exchange, and you managed to attract an investor early on when you needed funding more.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="an-overview-of-juicebox-tooling">An overview of Juicebox tooling<a class="hash-link" href="#an-overview-of-juicebox-tooling" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Where Juicebox really shines is in its ability to give project creators full control over the tooling they wish to employ in their projects. There is a rich help section along with a glossary on info.juicebox.money, but for a brief overview read on to learn some of the basics.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="distribution-limit">Distribution Limit<a class="hash-link" href="#distribution-limit" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The easiest way to think of this is by answering this question: how many funds do you need to keep the lights on for your project, and how frequently do you need them? Do you have a dev team that needs to be paid, or server hosting fees, a content writer, etc.? Whatever those costs amount to will tell you the amount of funds you need to keep your project stable and going forward.</p><p>Do you need $2000 every two weeks? $1000 every ten days? $5000 a month? Whatever time and amount you need is what you will declare as your “distribution limit” when you create a JB project.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="overflow">Overflow<a class="hash-link" href="#overflow" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>If your project receives more funds than you declared in your distribution limit, those extra funds will sit in a treasury. These extra funds are called overflow. Token holders can at any time redeem their tokens (trade in their tokens) for a portion of the value of overflow in your project. If your project has huge overflow because it has become very successful, then token holders can get a piece of that success by redeeming their tokens.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reserve-rate">Reserve Rate<a class="hash-link" href="#reserve-rate" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The reserve rate is what percentage of tokens you keep every time you mint tokens. You can set this anywhere from zero to one hundred percent or in between. Setting a reserve rate allows your project to accrue tokens. Not having a reserve rate means that all tokens you mint will go to contributors.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="redemption-rate">Redemption Rate<a class="hash-link" href="#redemption-rate" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The redemption rate is something you set that determines how much value redeemed tokens will have based on when they are redeemed. If somebody redeems their tokens right away, they will get less proportional overflow value than someone who waits until later to redeem their tokens. A redemption rate incentivizes people to stick around as your project grows, and it disincentivizes investors who are just looking to make a quick buck. You can set an aggressive or weak redemption rate, or none at all, when you create a Juicebox project.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="weight">Weight<a class="hash-link" href="#weight" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The term <em>weight</em> simply means how many tokens or other assets, such as NFTs, a contributor will receive for a set amount of contribution. For instance, a contributor who puts $1000 into your project may receive a million tokens (if you so choose).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="burning-versus-redeeming-tokens">Burning versus Redeeming tokens<a class="hash-link" href="#burning-versus-redeeming-tokens" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Whenever someone gives back their tokens, those tokens are destroyed permanently. If a token holder gives back tokens for a share of the overflow, we call this “redeeming” the tokens. Let’s say, however, that there is no overflow. In that case, the tokens are still traded in and destroyed, but they don’t yield any value back. When this happens, we call it “burning” tokens.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together<a class="hash-link" href="#putting-it-all-together" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The importance of JB really sits with the excellent tooling suite you receive by using it.

So for the last few funding Cycles, we&#x27;ve been operating in two experiments, which has been really great. These align with the Juicebox funding Cycles, I&#x27;ll drop a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/jbx-protocol/projects/1/views/20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> in the town hall chat for those who haven&#x27;t seen it before. So we&#x27;re basically scheduling issues every two weeks that is aligned with the JuiceboxDAO funding cycle. And I think what we&#x27;re going to plan to do is to give a recap of the previous funding cycle every two weeks. So next week, we&#x27;ll give a recap of all the stuff that was done in the last two weeks, which is going to be really really great this time around there&#x27;s been so much done. So definitely don&#x27;t want to miss that. </p><p>I want to highlight one quick fun feature. That was merged yesterday. So this is the ability to add Banny stickers to Memos, which is a small thing, but potentially a fun feature which some of you have been enjoying. So thank you for everyone who worked on that particularly JohnnyD who led the implementation. Check <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnnyD_eth/status/1536600334507843586" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JohnnD&#x27;s twitter</a> for a video demo of this.</p><p>There&#x27;s four big things in flight at the moment. And I&#x27;ll list them out in order of the time that they&#x27;ll be shipped more or less. </p><ol><li>The first is giving projects the ability to relaunch on V2 and giving token holders the ability to migrate their tokens to the V2 project.</li><li>Second is V2 project handles, which is being led by Peri. Right now projects on V2 don&#x27;t have handles like they did in V1 so that is adding support for those. </li><li>The third is NFT rewards for projects. Essentially it&#x27;s giving projects the ability to specify like if you contribute a certain amount of funds to this project, then we will reward you with an NFT. So that&#x27;s going to be really exciting giving projects another avenue to get funding which is great. </li><li>And then the fourth is obviously veBanny and staking.</li></ol><p>So I will quicking give an overview of what&#x27;s in store with V1 V2 migration, basically we need to give V1 projects the ability to relaunch on V2. So the canonical example is juiceboxDAO. We&#x27;re a V1 projects. We also now have a V2 project but none of our funds are in the V2 project.</p><p>What&#x27;s gonna happen is the projects will re-launch on V2, JuiceboxDAO has already done that so we have a project on V2. They&#x27;re then gonna move their whole balance to the V2 project. They&#x27;re going to add another payment terminal to the V2 project, and this is a special payment terminal where it&#x27;ll accept a V1 token and then return the V2 token in a 1:1 exchange rate.</p><p>So basically if I have Juicebox V1 token, there&#x27;ll be a place in the interface to go to swap my V1 tokens for the new V2 tokens. And that&#x27;s pretty much it. So the contracts are more or less done. Thank you to jango Dr.Gorilla and whoever else worked on that. That was really quick turnaround. And now it&#x27;s pretty much up to the front end to get the UI done for all of what I just explained. And then we&#x27;ll finally have upgrade path to some V1 projects to get on V2 and use all the cool new stuff. </p><p><strong>@peri</strong>: I think as everybody knows we still aren&#x27;t supporting project handles for the new V2 projects. And this is basically just has to do with some of the changes that are made in the contracts. We used to store a handle for a project on chain and it requires a lot of extra finessing in the contracts because we had to make sure that people can use the same contract and that handles could be transferred and reserved for certain period of time and claimed, there&#x27;s a lot of functionalities to bake in. So with the V2 project contracts, we just skipped over all that because it ended up not being very necessary for the functionality of the contracts themselves. But the downside of course is that it&#x27;s really nice to have in the app to be able to look up projects and search for projects.</p><p>So we&#x27;ve been working on another layer, another contract to add into the existing contracts that will support handles for V2 projects. It is not quite finished and it&#x27;s not on mainnet yet.  But we do have everything kind of functionally together so I can give a demo of how it&#x27;ll work in the app and explain how it works pretty quickly.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/njwILOI-d2fd6e7b5384dbdd906a0c382e8540e1.png" width="1280" height="1438" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><em>(screen sharing ongoing)</em></p><p>So I&#x27;ve got this empty project here on Rinkeby, ID 4117.  And we are going to set a handle for this project. </p><p>We&#x27;ve got a two-transaction-process for setting a project handle. And so the way that this works is we decided to use ENS names to handle the uniqueness of project handles what I mentioned earlier for making sure that handles be passed around and exchanged. There&#x27;s a lot of complexity there that ENS has already solved really beautifully and so we built the system around ENS names. The idea here is that if you want to use a handle for a project you will need to own the matching ENS name. So for example, I just got this ENS name on rinkby testinginprod.eth and this would allow me to set the handle of this project to testinginprod. So I&#x27;m gonna do two steps here,</p><ol><li>I have to own this ENS name first of course,  I&#x27;m going to set the ENS name testinginprod.eth and this would be one transaction. Once this completes, step one will be done.</li><li>The next step here is to actually set a text record on the ENS name. So if anybody&#x27;s used the ENS name app before you&#x27;ll know that you can come down and set these text records for any number of different things. We are using a particular key &quot;Juicebox project ID&quot;. You can come and set this property in the ENS name app manually if you want, but that&#x27;s a little bit of extra work. So we&#x27;ve made it nice, pretty and clean in the app and you can basically come down here and click this button and we&#x27;re gonna set that value in the ENS name text record to the ID of this project. So this one is 4117. So I&#x27;m going to send this transaction, which is the same as if I just came over here and just manually put 4117 here. That&#x27;ll show up here if you got the handle set up.</li></ol><p>Most importantly that&#x27;ll allow your project to be searched on the projects page. Right now the search bar works by searching for project handles and V2 projects don&#x27;t have handles you can&#x27;t search for them. It&#x27;s very lame that is now a thing of the past as soon as you set a handle for your project. Your project will be searchable. </p><p>An important thing to note is that either of these things change, for example if you were to transfer the ENS name and someone else changes that text record, your handle will go back to empty. So you have to have both of these things set constantly or if you were to change this to some other ENS name, your handle would go back to empty.</p><p>Another fun fact is you can also actually do subdomains here. </p><p>We will hopefully have that on mainnet this week. I&#x27;m pretty sure we&#x27;re doing. some just some last-minute things, but mostly everything is good to go. So expect it pretty soon. </p><p><strong>@0xSTVG:</strong> So does that mean that I could create multiple projects with subdomains of my ENS?</p><p><strong>@peri</strong>: You could. But you can&#x27;t have multiple projects using the same ENS name. So if you had like STVG.eth, and you want to do like one project one.STVG.eth and the other project two.STVG.eth, those could be two separate handles for different projects.</p><p>@mieos: Once we get that up and running, I think a screen recording of you going through that or WAGMI can put together a little infographic on what it is and how it works, especially when it gets up to the subdomain part, it&#x27;s just technical enough. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="vebanny-by-jmill">veBanny by @Jmill<a class="hash-link" href="#vebanny-by-jmill" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I want to show a map with the veBanny stuff. I&#x27;ve been doing some work on the subgraph implementation to index the user tokens and interact with them. Right now we had a couple of big steps forward. One thing is there&#x27;s now a metadata file to parse for all the the characters or the variants so you can go through and scroll through the characters and figure out which one you want and then you can see them all in here, too. So that&#x27;s been a nice upgrade because you can pull that all from one place now.</p><p><em>(screen sharing ongoing)</em></p><p>So these are NFT positions that I&#x27;ve taken on this account. So you like lock positions that are actually coming from on chain. And then you can interact with them also, so I can do that to extend the lock or I can unlock the ones that have finished. So I can take this one and extend the lock like a thousand days. Then it takes a minute for the graph to re-index it, but it&#x27;ll show up 30 seconds later with the new lockdate.</p><p>And then other than that I showed this last week, we have a new contract where you can mint for one second just like test the unlock and redeem stuff. But yeah, I showed this on the last demo where you can  also like take a staking position and actually mint these things through the front end works also. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="quizz-time">quizz time:<a class="hash-link" href="#quizz-time" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/AME442G-b0e7abeb37a8aa055a5a588739f9df56.png" width="954" height="515" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The answer is....</p><p><strong>Nicholas</strong></p><ul><li>As a student I made jewelry and garment. </li><li>I was a nationally ranked debater.</li><li>I haven&#x27;t been Malta before.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="nft-update-by-johnnyd">NFT update by @JohnnyD<a class="hash-link" href="#nft-update-by-johnnyd" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><strong>@JohnnyD</strong>: I&#x27;ll just add a few sentences to what @aeolian has summarized before.

It’s been really good. Some good wins, we think, and some good projects to follow up on.

I think it’s really important to fish out what a project wants and what needs we’re there to give them. From there we’ll know what JB features that’ll help them the most— whether that be transparency in earning/spending, or the ease of launching an ERC-20 token and having that distributed to people upon contributing. Or whether automating payments out of the treasury and restricting/reconfigurations of that spending are the way they want to go.

I definitely have ideas around that; mainly I really like the idea of categorizing particular common projects/project types, like NFC Coops, straight up Web3 businesses, or the classic one-time fundraiser. I think having clear resources for these like links to pre-filled templates could be super helpful and useful. Essentially, we want people to come to the site and feel comfortable setting up a project themselves without having someone walking them through it.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="for-sure-out-of-curiosity-what-was-it-like-gallivanting-around-with-zeugh">For sure.

Before JB a group of friends and I started getting into NFTs and we wanted to create a DAO to be an NFT Coop, with the goal being to acquire some of the more expensive NFTs. Aeolian was one of my buddies in that NFT and he found JB and looked at the github, started working a bit on it, and told me about it. After a week or so I started doing the same. It was so exciting, I pretty much quit my job 2 weeks later and said okay, I’m doing this.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="front-end-seems-like-so-cross-disciplinary-youre-juggling-user-interfacedesign-along-with-coding-whats-that-like">Front-end seems like so cross-disciplinary.

According to @Zeugh, they came from several big Telegram chat groups that are mainly focused on airdrops. There might be a misintrepretation that if they create a project on rinkeby.juicebox.money and give feedback in the Discord server, they will be entitiled to some kind of Juicebox airdrop. <strong>We don&#x27;t have any airdrop currently.</strong></p><p><strong>Zeugh</strong>： I think it won&#x27;t do any substantial harm to JuiceboxDAO, and think it a great opportunity to showcase the functionalities of our protocol to these people, and to onboard some new members who are really interested in our products.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="vebanny-front-end-updates-by-jmill">veBanny Front End updates by @Jmill<a class="hash-link" href="#vebanny-front-end-updates-by-jmill" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><strong>Jmill</strong>: I have been working pretty extensively on the veBanny front end, trying to get it out the door. Now that the contracts are deployed, we can work to transactions and use real data.</p><p>(<em>sharing screen and demonstrating the process of staking tokens for an Locked NFT</em>)</p><p>So we&#x27;re now minting this thing through the website which is cool. The stuff is all working now, and show up pretty cool.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: I&#x27;ve also been on the contract side of things that @Viraz has been doing a great job, asking for reviews over the tests. The tests he&#x27;s writing and adding more fuzzing tests to the suite. So hopefully at this point, it&#x27;s throwing a lot of use cases at the cocept. And i suppose it&#x27;ll make way on to the actual final details to complete the workflow.</p><p><strong>Jmill</strong>: The big thing next is to read the onchain data and get the use of NFT, and then allow them to extend their locked positions on a particular NFT. All of those are related to fetching data, about multiple tokens. We&#x27;re talking about this in Peel&#x27;s Discord, and right now it&#x27;s implemented as ERC-721 Enumerable, but it&#x27;ll probably be easier if it were structured similiar with Juicebox projects where you have a directory structure and subgraph, to look that information up without recursive calls to open by index. So that&#x27;s probably what we need to start thinking about how we index these information for the purpose of front end to grab it and work with the data. </p><p><strong>jango</strong>: Yeah, that makes sense. Also from a juiceboxDAO or Juicebox perspective in Juicebox.money, we&#x27;ll possibly first have to deploy their staking contract and specify the lock duration they want etc. It isn&#x27;t going to be there for everyone first, they have to specify those things, so that that initial transaction to deploy a staking contract will go through a contract that somewhat serve as a directory or at least it&#x27;ll file an event that&#x27;s indexable to service a directory. If Peel and Juicebox.money feel it a decent thing to offer all projects over time and they should be able to interact with that same depolyer contract to get their own version of this.</p><p><strong>filipv</strong>:What&#x27;s the timeline looking like? Is that somehting we can expect deploying in the next month?</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: We need V1 &gt; V2 migration to do it for JuiceboxDAO. We can deploy this for an arbitrary project though. We can launch a new project and just has it work there, so you can start minting stuff, just as normal treasury and lock it there, at which point there&#x27;s not much difference between test and rinkeby as we currently are. But to get the JuiceboxDAO version of this and the Bannyverse version at least from a ecosystem perspective, we need to get V1 &gt; V2 migration, and then there might be other technical things along the way.</p><p><strong>Jmill</strong>: From a front end perspective, there are a couple of things that would be helpful so that there&#x27;s some kind of indexing data you can easily pull user&#x27;s NFT statistics. That&#x27;s a more simple and scalable way to do with subgraph query. It would be really usefull if the ve NFT contract deployer also deploy a single consolidated metadata file. Let&#x27;s say veBanny has 60 characters and they all have a name and staking ranges, it&#x27;ll be really nice that the contract generate that as one file that front end could grab and parse to display without going to 60 metadata files individually. That would be a quality-of-life thing from the contract side for the front end.</p><p><strong>tankbottoms</strong>: We could add another function for that metadata, basically something that will conform with an NFT but also has pointers to all assets you need, because you can pick them through the JSONs however you want.</p><p><strong>Jmill</strong>: The last item I have here is that we&#x27;re implementing beneficiary for this, so that users can stake and put someone else as the beneficiary.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: That&#x27;ll be useful for even a DAO to lock its supply, and designate other contributor or some other beneficiary for. It&#x27;s cool to have flexibility. The core thing being built allows everyone on the peripheral of the project to start to wrap their heads around what situation it&#x27;s gonna be when this thing is out there.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="product-prospective-with-zeugh">Product prospective with @Zeugh<a class="hash-link" href="#product-prospective-with-zeugh" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/ktQrGSS-a6a1f2e23428f4842bea76122e9ce4af.png" width="1830" height="698" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>Zeugh</strong>: The Juicebox.money is a complex thing to use. I think it will be something to see that front end are more focused on some type of projects. Let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s a NFT project wants to launch its treasury on Juicebox, they can have a direct way for easy launch to help set it up ahead of time. You want to launch a NFT project and make the funds through Juicebox so people can co-own the treasury like tileDAO did and issue tokens for people that are minting.</p><p>Those are some of the configurations that we think we should do. That could be something like Juicebox.nft instead of Juicebox.money. And if you want to go to the hard mode and be able to configure every single thing, that&#x27;s still running on the same protocol.</p><p>That&#x27;s what I call the product prospective. We have a very good protocol perspective here that is building something really robust and can do lots of things. In the end looking at product level, maybe not all the users will need all of these things and having an easy way to launch might be something interesting.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: I think there&#x27;s a lot of to keep improving the onboarding stuff and especially we just came out of V2 trying to start with parity where V1 was. The name of the game now is just constant improving based on our own interest with onboarding as well as pulling together other people&#x27;s perspective. It&#x27;s hard to be certain that it&#x27;s one thing or another thing from my point of view, but without question we&#x27;re going to hinge towards better alternatives to prototypes that are massively useful. Shout out to JohnnyD and Aeolian and all the people in Peel who are eager and quick to make prototypes and start discord threads so that we can discuss the improvements. And then match this with a occasional AHA moment that a few different ideas come together that make sense to a lot of folks and somehow we unlock a lot more fluidity to the onboarding process. </p><p>I&#x27;m certainly with you that we have a lot of work to do with explaining what people are getting into, like starting with giving everyone all the information upfront and make all risks as clear as possible. Overtime we can start to reel back into some managable shortcuts. </p><p>I think now we&#x27;re definitely buckling for more long term investments both from a building perspective and the relationship perspective with other communities. I&#x27;m eager to see how that project chart changes over time. I think from my personal perspective and talking to projects, the recent lows haven&#x27;t been very encouraging for projects to launch. But now that V2 is out, we&#x27;re going to see a lot more of that.</p><p><strong>nicholas</strong>: When I did onboarding with Austin from BuildGuild and he had some feedback about simplifying. It&#x27;s a little bit difficult for someone on the outside to know exactly which simplifying approach will be successfull on the market aside from just iterating on simplifying the existing one. But I do have some suspicion that there are a larger category of people who are not so inclined to use Juicebox in its current form but might be inclined to do so for this example we&#x27;re talking couple of times about NFT collections, splitting off a portion of their primary and/or secondary to Juicebox and letting the holders manage it, which doodles, cryptopunks and a bunch of other projects already do. That&#x27;s a category I&#x27;m super interested in getting on the creation flow for that. It could be just like presets on what we&#x27;ve already got, or maybe an entirely separate creation flow where you can imagine entirely different front ends that just make creation really tight for a specific use case and then you can go use Juicebox.money&#x27;s full advanced front end and subsequently managing those things but make it easier for people to get onboard. It could be pretty integrated at Juicebox.money. There&#x27;s a lot to explore.</p><p><strong>filipv</strong>: One thng that we&#x27;ve discussed that might be interesting would be if there&#x27;s a way to easily import and export project configurations which Austin Griffith originally brought up, for exporting a project that was made on testnet to mainnet. That might be cool because you can use that feature to set up templates that have base project configurations.</p><p>Another thing I want to talk about is what we&#x27;re discussing a lot in the chat about amount of metrics. I&#x27;m not sure how useful focusing on any specific North Star metric would be. It&#x27;s very hard to encapsulate everything in Juicebox, and I think everything is conflating with each other. So I think we can take anything and roll with it, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worthy going super deep into which is the best North Star metric.</p><p><strong>Aeolian</strong>: I&#x27;m totally with @filipv. I think the goal I originally had with proposing this metric was not so much like &quot;ok! Let&#x27;s review this number every week!&quot; or &quot;Oh! it&#x27;s going down, what&#x27;s happening?&quot; It&#x27;s more like what we&#x27;re all in some sense collectively optimizing for everything from a product, website, documentation and content strategy, the whole thing. Our goal right now is to increase the number of active projects. I agree with you that at this stage where traffic is still very low, really trying to hatch out a metric that&#x27;s instructive right now. It&#x27;s more to get us all on the same page.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: I think the general consensus is that it feels good to have activity. I guess you could put on a chart and optimize for it, but personally I want to think about metrics that make me lean in more in moment&#x27;s notice seeing activities, and seeing folks I know engaging with other projects making me want to learn more about them.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="govenance-discussion">Govenance discussion<a class="hash-link" href="#govenance-discussion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><strong>@filipv</strong>: I want to open up some discussion on the recent governance cycle, both in itself and some of the proposals. </p><p>One thing I want to bring up first is the possibility of changing the governance cycle in order to allow for longer temperature checks because I definitely feel the temp check are too short. But there&#x27;s also balance if you lengthen the temp check, it makes it harder to get things through the governance process and it takes longer to get things done. We did a poll and people are really into the weekday idea.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/nG8Bn2D-7b9c7c25f95d53b41aefb6272167a809.png" width="772" height="668" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>nicholas</strong>: Since people prefer temp check ends during the week, I&#x27;d particularly like the proposal edit freeze to happen during the week, because I had to spend a lot of Sundays modifying proposals because people obviously just give comments leading up to the freeze and I prefer it end in the week. I understand people have jobs and I am certain that might not be convenient, but people from the poll seem to be happy with that idea.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: For me personally, it&#x27;s nice to end on weekend because I can do a lot more meeting oriented and dev oriented stuff during the week, and in the weekend, I can read the proposals and think about those. There&#x27;s not much weekend breaktime.</p><p><strong>nicholas</strong>: How specified should proposals be? I made a suggestion that is three points if you add them to the proposals,
<img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/GbRQJsd-14e72c17e289c704f7e2a262f74a288e.png" width="2020" height="946" class="img_ev3q">
maybe they will enable more delegation, because a lot of the burden getting the proposal through can be like knowing exactly what steps should be taken, when it&#x27;s not always necessary DAO knows every single steps if DAO is willing to accept the risks, the implementation risk of someone delegating it to the person who&#x27;s the author or someone specified in the proposal. I think it&#x27;s a decent choice if it&#x27;s a better financial allocation and also adding a risk in risk section which is like &quot;Look, we&#x27;re not specifying the address the money got set to, we don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a super important detail for the DAO to be voting on&quot;, but that&#x27;s a risk we can screw up sending it to a wrong address because it wasn&#x27;t specified in the proposal. It allow the proposal to move forward before all those details are sorted out. Some proposal do deserve to have hyper detailed specifications and it&#x27;s important for the DAO to vote on it, others delegation will be more appropriate. I think that might be a interesting format for making governance more manageable. </p><p><strong>filipv</strong>: I&#x27;m definitely onboard with that. I think that thing need to be weighted very carefully just because it&#x27;s not like we are going through a hierachy and people are revising it in every step. It&#x27;s kind of like every proposal goest to the multisig like the one source of truth. It&#x27;s like something running close to the middel very powerful and very dangerous. I think we need to be careful about specifications and and we don&#x27;t want to lead to some DAO crisis when people are disagreeing on an interpretation of the proposal after the fact.</p><p>First of all it waste a bunch of time, also people are gonna get upset and may lead to conflicts. So I am generally more of a stickler that we should have very specific proposals just because how dangerous it is. I wonder if there is a way to incentivize people to submit a bunch of proposals earlier so they can be spread out ever a greater period of time. We really see most proposal submitted close to the end of temp check. It&#x27;s not an easy question to solve.</p><p><strong>nicholas</strong>: Part of the challenge is the 14days cycle, if you would like to submit a proposal for something and temp check submission just opened, that means you  can no longer submit a proposal and you could be waiting for 20+ days till the next opportunity to vote. It may be worthwhile, for instance the bug bounty, I can see both sides on it, maybe a longer process allow us to consider, but at the same time, the protocol needs the bounty pretty badly. </p><p>I think it would be of some value not entirely in the direction of everything being specified because the reality is that just making through all of that governance and having opinions on it is stretching the limits of the bandwidth of even the most dedicated members of the DAO. It also becomes less decentralized the more because people are just voting along with other people who have already voted. There&#x27;s also some needs to us to recognize that actually the DAO doesn&#x27;t need to vote on every single details of everything, and some amount of delegation is probably gonna be necessary over the medium term. </p><p><strong>filipv</strong>: Two thoughts on that.</p><p>One is that I don&#x27;t see why we couldn&#x27;t do it right now like approving a budget in advance to reduce future governance overhead and go through that process. I think that&#x27;s very achievable and I&#x27;m interested in pursuing that.</p><p>Second thought is that jango has be mentioning lately the idea of possibly pursuing funding for projects and budgets for projects rather that fuding budgets for individuals or groups, which I think compelling because the structure of what we are doing shifts a lot and it&#x27;s the post V2 transitory period. So I wonder maybe a shift towards budgeting for things get done rather than having all these smaller individual small group proposals may accomplish what you are talking about being able to improve things in advance and delegates to someone who&#x27;s leading the project.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: Some of the treasury allocations have also been tricky in the past weeks because we&#x27;ve been tuning the treasury create stuff on and off while we address some protocol problem. Those should be made well in advance in proposals being specified to be directed towards them. I am definitely in the camp of more hyper specificity upfront and throughout the temp check process.</p><p><strong>filipv</strong>: Would you want to work with Juicebox if you didn&#x27;t get funding through an individual basis, but rather as a part of multiple projects?</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: The end of payment routing is still individual payout, either from a project that you control like what JohnnyD has, or through a direct payment from a project. The idea is that it&#x27;s just not managed by a conglomerate governance system.</p><p><strong>felixander</strong>: I want to talk with JohnnyD and Aeolian about this. What happens when you bring a human on for a projects and the project is solved? It doesn&#x27;t make sense for the system now because we&#x27;ve committed a budget to something that only took 2-3 months, but now somebody is there, but they&#x27;re taking on another work that might be totally separating them from what they&#x27;re doing. I think it&#x27;s something a little bit messy in terms of how the payment structure works presently.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: I feel that kind of work is really important when a project is starting out, that&#x27;s still the case now and will likely still be months into the future. There&#x27;s a lot happening and everyone is contributing to whatever the next person needs. So people are just shouting &quot;hey I got this dope thing in progress, it&#x27;d be sweet if I could have this ounce of help&quot; and luckily there&#x27;s a lot of people around who are eager and feeling supportive to do that work. So the individual payouts feel appropriate in that world.</p><p>I think that would set the expectation that there&#x27;s a lot of stuff that we&#x27;ve building isn&#x27;t just onging forever, we&#x27;re not hired by JuiceboxDAO to be here comfortably and feel valued imbued and viewed by our relationship to one another and to the concept of the projects. Once those projects play themselves out, I think it&#x27;s healthy to reassess what our purpose is amongst current state of the projects and how we can prepare ourselves for future state of uncertainty which are always upon us. That&#x27;s the thing we can almost guarantee. </p><p><strong>felixander</strong>: Would that be the same way like Peel, WAGMI and Canu, the idea that people would branch off like Peel now is under a budget to do front end? You could imagine people who are doing docs would branch out and have a budget, and people who are doing translation would also branch off and have a budget.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: I think that&#x27;s in a creative part and I&#x27;m sure everyone will bring their own taste of how to frame these things. It&#x27;s effective to pay Peel to work on the Juicebox.money project, front end developers can assess each other&#x27;s contributions and payouts better than any multidisciplinary group would.</p><p>These things will inevitably shift and change over time, as people come and go, as well as the projects changing. It&#x27;s tougher for the community to rationalize consistent budgeting for an abtract group of people with an abtract but pointed mission, the individuals are liquid between all these project organizaitons and we hve to respect that. People are going to find their leverage over time and they don&#x27;t owe anything to any organizations. We&#x27;re all just building ourselves out and learning from each other in  this whole process. I think we&#x27;re going to see a lot of different ways to organize it.</p><p>Shout out to Zom_Bae creating the Juicebox events version for the upcoming ice cream event and it&#x27;s in a potential to add more longevity to that concept. What if we&#x27;re to actually trying to fund events consistently and have a pool of resources that we can make this up every single time. We can just re-reference something that we know to be true already.</p><p>I think we&#x27;re on the same page eventually. We&#x27;ve got to create the right incentive model to shift away from building up the Juicebox foundation to supporting one in any numbers of projects and then servie it to the world and make it the gateway. But as the protocol tends towards stability, it&#x27;ll be great to have tighter articulation of what it means for a project to succeed over time.</p><p><strong>Aeolian</strong>: I do like what @casstoshi brought up about the idea of each group having a budget and individual contributors are paid from that budget. I think Peel has done this. At a time all the front end people were doing individual proposals to JuiceboxDAO and the sentiment was that it&#x27;s hard to evaluate these proposals. So intead JuiceboxDAO votes on a single budget for front end and that team can handle that budget as they see fit.</p><p>I&#x27;ll post a <a href="https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp68-modify-protocol-engineering-core-unit-budget-pe-001/13797" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> that Drgorilla posted earlier about how makerDAO manages this process where there&#x27;s a clear budget for each abstract collecton of people. It definitely breaks down as we&#x27;ve seen with some proposals over the last couple of weeks. It&#x27;s hard to pinpoint someone into one of those particular groups, people can work ver much across thses groups.</p><p>I still think it&#x27;s instrutive not only from accounting perspective but also from an organizational perspective, it just makes it easy to reason about someone&#x27;s payout if they&#x27;re clearly contributing to a specific area.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-highlights">Project highlights<a class="hash-link" href="#project-highlights" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><strong>gogo</strong>: I&#x27;m very glad to be able to discover the future of ComicsDAO and strategy of what we&#x27;re gonna do there.

What I would like to propose is that this is our heroes Banny and they&#x27;re travelling throught the DAO galaxy to DAOs. We would like to know where JuiceboxDAO would like the ship to go to the next DAO, so that we can keep on building covers to next DAO.

I love the treasury management, a part of which is to buy rare comics and hold thme, but the day to day potential of being the storytelling branch of differnt DAOs, which is immensely powerful. And so far you are all playing really well, well done.</p><p><strong>nicholas</strong>: There&#x27;re a bunch of really cool projects this week. JokeDAO just launched a super sick governance experimentation project. </p><p>Austin Griffith&#x27;s BuildGuild got launched this week and there&#x27;s a proposal to fund a hackathon for them to transform scaffold-eth into something compatible with Juicebox or to build the hackathon projects using scaffold-eth with juicebox involved in the picture. And as jango mentioned in  his twitter that Juicebox front end is based on scaffold-eth. </p><p>So it&#x27;s very cool to see comfort circle, and hopefully we will be able to fund a modest hackathon to get the treasury kickstarted with funds, hopefully getting that brew of hackers into the ecosystem. </p><p>@twodam&#x27;s has posted a twitter about this week&#x27;s projects <a href="https://twitter.com/twodam_eth/status/1534200052511518720" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

Thank you @nicholas for doing a lot. Most excited once we get the V1 V2 token stuff, situated to start talking to the SharkDAO, or a lot of folks operating on V1 still doing ongoing work and fundraising, to see if they want to move over and leverage some of the new tools to make their projects more successful, whatever that means to them these days.

We’re stuck in a beautiful moment where V2 is starting to open up an opportunity for non full-web3 nerds, whereas with V1 there really wasn’t much chance for non web3-nerds.

I think good branding does that. It points people in the right direction for the kind of info they want. I’ve always wanted Wagmi to be more educational, but when we started to do this with V1, V2 was on the horizon so we held off. After all with all the changes coming with V2 it didn’t make sense to produce a lot of content that would all just have to be redone a few months later.

We could give these projects a little shove in the creative department, whether by helping them with animations, designing mascots, and who knows what else.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ive-felt-like-jb-high-could-be-a-central-point-of-info-for-newbies-obviously-a-lot-of-that-exists-already-elsewhere-on-the-web-but-do-you-see-any-value-in-really-doing-like-a-web3-crash-course-on-jb-high-to-truly-onboard-a-total-n00b-from-starting-to-finishing-their-first-project-creation">I’ve felt like JB High could be a central point of info for newbies. Obviously a lot of that exists already elsewhere on the web, but do you see any value in really doing like a “web3 crash course” on JB High to truly onboard a total n00b from starting to finishing their first project creation?<a class="hash-link" href="#ive-felt-like-jb-high-could-be-a-central-point-of-info-for-newbies-obviously-a-lot-of-that-exists-already-elsewhere-on-the-web-but-do-you-see-any-value-in-really-doing-like-a-web3-crash-course-on-jb-high-to-truly-onboard-a-total-n00b-from-starting-to-finishing-their-first-project-creation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I don’t think it’s overkill to do that at all, we just have to be clear on our time cost, and we shouldn’t invest too much time if there are more efficient ways to do it. I think a web3 crash course could be done in 2-3 animated shorts plus maybe a page or two on JB High; it’s not a heavy lift.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-it-changed-since-youve-been-there">How’d you get started with JB, and how has it changed since you’ve been there?<a class="hash-link" href="#howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-it-changed-since-youve-been-there" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>From the very beginning, I was trying to figure out from what JB could be. Jango’s take was that JB was a payment terminal, so I was like okay, are we building Stripe for web3? But then he was talking about treasuries, and discount rates and bonding curves, and pre-minting tokens and reserve rates, and I was like man, nobody’s gonna have any idea what this is. When I finally grokked it I was like “Ohhhh, this is what this could be!”</p><p>I saw some possible use cases, and was talking to some of the early guys about what it could do, but I think none of us really grasped it. It was so new and there just wasn’t really a concept you could build off, you really had to understand it for what it was, as something unique, and that took time.</p><p>But before even all that happened, I was working with Sage to figure out the brand and how we can we make this whole JB thing feel cool, and actually one of the first things we messed with was claymation.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-saw-a-claymation-video-floating-around-is-that-one-of-those-early-things">I saw a claymation video floating around! Is that one of those early things?<a class="hash-link" href="#i-saw-a-claymation-video-floating-around-is-that-one-of-those-early-things" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Yeah, that’s one of the first things Wagmi ever did! It was a lot of fun.</p><p>Another biggie early on, actually probably the first thing that came up as important, was starting to think was how could we help people understand what JB could do. So I figured “Oh, I could launch a project on JB and that could serve as an example for people of what to do.”</p><p>So I told Sage, hey, let’s run something like an animated studio/illustration studio out of JB, really as an example of JB’s power, and that was the birth of Wagmi. And it has been an absolutely great example. I’m really glad we did that rather than stay as paid contributors in JB itself. It serves as a great example for how projects can coexist in the space and serve one another.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="was-jb-your-first-jump-into-web3">Was JB your first jump into web3?<a class="hash-link" href="#was-jb-your-first-jump-into-web3" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Yeah, it was! I’ve just always been interested in tech projects and when I got to know jango and peri and they were talking about tech projects I just wanted to hang out and learn, and to try to help in any way I could.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="man-thats-such-a-high-bar-for-a-n00b-to-get-into">Man, that’s such a high bar for a n00b to get into.<a class="hash-link" href="#man-thats-such-a-high-bar-for-a-n00b-to-get-into" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Haha, yeah it was a high bar, I still remember it took me 4 months! I spent 4 months saying the words and having no idea what I was talking about— “Yeah yeah yeah, the payment terminal, and getting ETH out and bonding curve, and the redemption rate,” I had no idea what I was talking about, and then, finally one day it clicked! It was so rewarding, and it validated to me so much of what I had been trying to grasp.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-ran-into-that-in-a-very-dense-philosophy-text-once-that-was-like-that-so-hard-to-grasp-you-wanna-walk-away-since-you-definitely-dont-wanna-stick-around-and-feel-stupid-thats-a-tough-spot-to-be-in">I ran into that in a very dense philosophy text once that was like that. So hard to grasp, you wanna walk away, since you definitely don’t wanna stick around and feel stupid. That’s a tough spot to be in.<a class="hash-link" href="#i-ran-into-that-in-a-very-dense-philosophy-text-once-that-was-like-that-so-hard-to-grasp-you-wanna-walk-away-since-you-definitely-dont-wanna-stick-around-and-feel-stupid-thats-a-tough-spot-to-be-in" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Yeah! Sticking around and feeling stupid sucks. You want to help, you want to chip in, and halfway through a sentence you realize damn, I don’t know what I’m saying, but now I’ve started talking and I gotta finish this sentence, haha. It’s like the brain needs contextual points of knowledge to learn the next thing, and some things are so far away from these basic knowledge nodes that you can’t bridge the concept. Then you’re like “Oh, it’s like Uber for Mcdonalds?” and it clicks all of a sudden. But what if you don’t have that basic script where you have to really put two or three of those nodes together to bridge over to a new concept. Sometimes you have the right teacher and they know that’s the case, and they’ll build that out for you, but otherwise you’re kind of reinventing the wheel in your mind, and for sure that can be so frustrating.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="im-glad-it-clicked-for-you-and-for-me-whos-your-fav-contributor-and-why-is-it-stevie-g">I’m glad it clicked for you (and for me!).

I would say the thing that attracts me to Stevie G is his uncanny ability to come off as hyper-authentic. There’s never a moment where I listen to him that I’m not like, “This dude is so real, he’s like, such a good human.” Regardless of whether or not you are a good human, or you think you are, many times I come off as an asshole—</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="oh-yeah-you-dont-need-to-tell-me-coming-off-like-an-asshole-unintentionally-is-a-lowkey-superpower-of-mine">Oh yeah, you don’t need to tell me, coming off like an asshole unintentionally is a lowkey superpower of mine…<a class="hash-link" href="#oh-yeah-you-dont-need-to-tell-me-coming-off-like-an-asshole-unintentionally-is-a-lowkey-superpower-of-mine" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Hahaha!

I actually used to be an avid kite boarder, but I picked an occupation that’s in direct conflict with kite boarding season. There was a point where I thought I may go pro. Hmm… other than that, as a child I was forced to do Hooked on Phonics, it’s probably not funny for anybody under the age of 35 since it didn’t exist for anybody that young, but like, when I had to do it, it was a joke, it was literally a joke that people would say to diss each other.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-remember-that-it-was-a-schoolyard-way-to-call-people-dumb">I remember that… it was a schoolyard way to call people dumb.<a class="hash-link" href="#i-remember-that-it-was-a-schoolyard-way-to-call-people-dumb" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Right!
