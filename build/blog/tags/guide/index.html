Juicebox has become a platform to support a thriving ecosystem of DAOs, who are all at different points in their development. It can be tough to stand out through the noise and develop a key marketing strategy for your project or DAO. Starting a successful web3 project is hard work with most projects on JuiceBox failing to attract more than 1 ETH in contributions.</p><p>Here are 3 tips for giving investors confidence and encouraging ETH contributions for you DAO, that I’ve learned from my time assisting at SharkDao.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="have-reputable-signers-for-the-multisig-and-a-plan-for-how-those-funds-are-released">Have reputable signers for the multisig and a plan for how those funds are released.<a class="hash-link" href="#have-reputable-signers-for-the-multisig-and-a-plan-for-how-those-funds-are-released" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>One of the first questions I ask when analyzing DAOs is “how are the funds secured?” If you’ve been paying attention to DeFi news recently you’ll have heard of the Wonderland fiasco, where one member with a shady history was allowed to manage the treasury of the DAO. This has not bode well for $TIME price action and the Wonderland community. Having reputable signers to properly store and distribute finds is crucial to the success of a DAO, no matter how big the treasury is.</p><p>The most common way to secure funds is to have multiple signers on Gnosis safe (more info here) to ensure that not any single person can rug the project. Many DAOs I’ve seen get past the first step of having a gnosis safe in the first place instead of just one wallet, but then fail the second part of security which is having reputable signers.</p><p>Having singers that check off at least some of these boxes can be a big confidence boost for potential members looking to invest into your project.</p><ol><li>A signer with an established presence on twitter</li><li>A signer involved in multiple projects throughout the crypto space</li><li>A signer who is doxxed and is reputable outside of the metaverse</li><li>A member of the Juicebox team</li><li>A member of a different prominent DAO or multisig signer.</li><li>A paid reputable neutral party to assist with signing (crypto funds, institutions, etc.)</li></ol><p>Ask around on discord and twitter, and you may be pleasantly surprised by the generosity of the web3 community to assist in your DAO, and maybe even make a friend or two.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="have-a-tokenomics-and-governance-strategy">Have a tokenomics and governance strategy<a class="hash-link" href="#have-a-tokenomics-and-governance-strategy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>If people are going to be contributing to your project, it helps to let potential new members know what exactly they are buying into.

Twitter and Discord have become the two go-to platforms for web3 communities, and are a tried and true recipe for success. Most web3 projects don’t ever launch to platforms like Instagram and Tiktok and still remain highly competitive. While other social media platforms may be helpful for your project, it’s best to stick to only twitter and discord, especially if you’re stretched for time and talent. If you market your twitter+discord well, it is far more effective than half a dozen social media platforms marketed mediocrely.</p><p>Successful web3 projects are able to leverage their twitter to attract high quality community members, who often become key contributors. Potential members will find your discord and evaluate the strength of your project, often based on aesthetic values at a first glance. Here’s a checklist to help you make sure your socials are well maintained</p><p>Twitter:</p><ol><li>Push twitter updates regularly. Daily is best, but at a bare minimum twice a week, or your project will start to appear absent and unmanaged.</li><li>Reply and engage with other twitter accounts, don’t only push status updates.</li><li>Have an engaging pinned tweet, and aesthetically pleasing profile picture+banner. First impressions are important.</li><li>Offer giveaways and contests to encourage engagement (don’t overdo it!).</li></ol><p>When starting a discord, it’s important that there’s someone to greet new members, be friendly, and answer questions. This person of contact is often called a community manager (CM). In larger projects, there’s often a dedicated CM to do this job, but in smaller projects this job usually falls to someone on the founding team. Regardless of who is assigned to these tasks, it’s important that there always be someone answering questions and directing people to proper resources in a reasonable amount of time.  Here are some tips to make a community managing less stressful, and more engaging for members.</p><p>Discord:</p><ol><li>Keep channels to a minimum when possible.</li><li>Clear and concise channel names and descriptions.</li><li>Create an FAQ + resource guide and update it regularly. If a question is asked twice, it’s a frequently asked question. Chances are it will be asked a third time.</li><li>Offer a fun and engaging role system for your discord. Some ideas: react roles where people can self assign, being helpful gets its own role, donators/investors get their own role.</li><li>Same as twitter, offer giveaways and contests to encourage engagement (again, don’t overdo it!)</li></ol><p>Put time, love, and energy into your socials and you’ll attract both capital and talent to your project.</p><p>-Synth</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/guide">guide</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/reserved-rate-as-a-growth-tuning-mechanism">Reserved rate as a growth tuning mechanism</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-12-12T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">December 12, 2021</time> · <!-- -->One min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/me_jango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1414958948189413395/l89bNR2m_400x400.jpg" alt="Jango"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/me_jango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Jango</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">JuiceboxDAO Contributor</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Communities using Juicebox can leverage their reserved rate decisively when they want to make it more difficult for new members to join.

I had first learned about DAOs a few years ago but never really understood what they did or how they got things done.  How do DAOs coordinate? How do they align their philosophy?  How did they keep each other accountable?  All of these questions were very difficult for me to wrap my head around. I then stumbled upon JB after finding out about the NOUNS project and then finding SharkDao which was using Juicebox for its treasury.</p><p>What I talked about with this JB community member was the fact that I didn&#x27;t say a word in Juicebox for 2 - 3 weeks.  I attended a couple of town hall meetings and listened in on some voice chats that were happening, not knowing what the agenda was or what they were going to be talking about.  I remember reading a bunch of  threads in Discord, trying to follow one or two specific issues, to see how the community tried to solve them.  What became clear was that it was important for me to not try to understand what a few people were doing, but to try and understand what the community was doing.  That was an epiphany for me.  It made me ask, &quot;where do this community&#x27;s values and my personal beliefs and ethics intersect?&quot;</p><p>This was the moment I started to look for tasks that helped me align myself with the community philosophy.  I started to shift my mindset from a quiet observer to thinking about how I could provide value that  could help advance the protocol and in turn, the Juicebox Community.  As I was exploring, I realized that I was also learning how to navigate the community.  How to navigate the notion, the web site, the Discord and everything else that might go along with JB.</p><p>To those wanting to become Juicebox contributors: follow a couple of tasks or issues and see how those issues are being solved by the community.  Then see if those solutions line up with how you might handle those issues. <strong>That doesn&#x27;t mean you have to agree.</strong>  It just means that how we talk to each other and how we interact with each other lines up with how you want to talk to people and how you want to be talked to.</p><p>If you start this way, not only will you find a way to contribute but you will see that the Juicebox community will help you contribute.  You&#x27;ll see that Juicebox will view you not just as someone that has a valuable skill but someone that has a philosophy that aligns with the goals of the Juicebox community.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/dao">dao</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/guide">guide</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/dao-tooling-101">DAO Tooling 101</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-12-06T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">December 6, 2021</time> · <!-- -->7 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/aeolianeth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1510052173073510401/14_Uoxzy_400x400.jpg" alt="Aeolian"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/aeolianeth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Aeolian</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Peel Contributor</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Entering the world of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) is kind of like opening the gates to Narnia: it&#x27;s thrilling, it&#x27;s confusing, and because real money is involved, it&#x27;s somewhat scary.</p><p>Late 2021 appears to be the frontier of DAOs, and best practices and playbooks for starting and governing DAOs are being written as I write this.</p><p>In particular, the DAO stack - the set of software tools required to run a DAO - is beginning to mature.

We&#x27;ll talk about DAOs as they are being used today in the crypto/NFT world. In this world, a DAO has 2 main functions:</p><ol><li>Building a treasury of assets (NFTs, Ethereum (ETH), or some other token)</li><li>Governing the treasury</li></ol><p>Let&#x27;s say your favorite podcaster decides to set up a DAO for their podcast. They need assets (read: money) to keep the podcast going and do bigger and better things like merch and in-person events. So, they need a way to build a treasury of assets. They&#x27;ll issue an ERC20 token (let&#x27;s call this token <code>$PODC</code>), and anyone who contributes funds to the treasury will receive <code>$PODC</code> token in exchange. You, the listener, believe in this podcaster and want to be a part of their success. So you buy some <code>$PODC</code> token and contribute to the treasury.</p><p>As a <code>$PODC</code> token holder, you have perks. You can propose changes to the podcast format and make guest proposals, and you can also vote on other proposals. You and the other token holders now have skin in the game - or skin in the podcast - and have a meaningful impact on the podcast and its success. The DAO can be creative here, too. Holding a token might grant you access to a private discord, private meetings, or airdrops. In a successful DAO, the DAO may vote to distribute excess funds to token holders.</p><p>Don&#x27;t like what the DAO is doing? No worries! Your tokens are 100% backed by the treasury, meaning you can sell your token back to the DAO and receive your original investment (less gas and other fees).</p><p>An attractive characteristic of a DAO when compared to a traditional private company is transparency. Every aspect of the DAO is available on and verified by, the blockchain. Any eager individual can observe the flow of assets and call out dodgy activity. Importantly, no accountants or lawyers are required!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-dao-stack"><strong>The DAO stack</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#the-dao-stack" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>To achieve the 2 functions of a DAO, we&#x27;re going to need some tools. Luckily, smart folks are putting in the leg work and the DAO stack is maturing rapidly. Below, we&#x27;ll discuss Juicebox, Gnosis, Snapshot, and Aragon - 4 key tools in the DAO stack - and how they fit together to form a DAO.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="juicebox"><strong>Juicebox</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#juicebox" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The <a href="https://juicebox.money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicebox</a> protocol is a programmable treasury. In practice, you can think of Juicebox as a decentralized alternative to Kickstarter; a way to raise funds on the blockchain. It fulfills the first function of the DAO: building the treasury. Technically speaking, Juicebox is a <a href="https://github.com/jbx-protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">set of smart contracts</a> deployed on the Ethereum blockchain that handles the issuance of tokens and the building of the treasury.</p><p>In our podcast DAO example, the podcaster would create a Juicebox project. They can define various parameters that dictate how the project will operate, like funding targets, the exchange rate, payouts, and the number of tokens reserved for founders. The Juicebox project has an associated token: <code>$PODC</code>. To contribute to the podcast DAO&#x27;s treasury, I would head to the project&#x27;s page on <a href="https://juicebox.money" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://juicebox.money</a>, connect my Metamask wallet and contribute ETH. In exchange, I would get some <code>$PODC</code> token based on the Juicebox project&#x27;s predefined exchange rate.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="gnosis"><strong>Gnosis</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#gnosis" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Who &quot;owns&quot; the treasury? A single person <em>could</em> own the treasury, but nothing is stopping them from running off with the bag besides reputational risk.</p><p>Enter: the multi-signature wallet, commonly known as a &quot;multisig&quot;. A multisig is fundamentally a contract that can hold assets and execute transactions, with one exception: it requires the signature of <em>more than one</em> address to execute transactions. Just like a business where you need multiple signatures to do anything, a multisig requires some number of signatures (typically <code>m</code> of <code>n</code>, say, 2 signatures out of 3 signatories) to execute a given transaction.</p><p>So, when setting up the podcast DAO, we would create a multisig between the podcast founders (say, the 2 podcasts hosts and any other significant contributors). The multisig would be the owner of the Juicebox project. This allows us to have multiple individuals controlling the parameters for fundraising so that no individual can go rogue.</p><p><a href="https://gnosis-safe.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gnosis</a> is the go-to tool for creating and managing multisigs. It provides a clean and simple UI to enable the management of a multisig. Signatories connect their Metamask wallet and can approve and reject transactions from Gnosis.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="snapshot"><strong>Snapshot</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#snapshot" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>How do you vote with your DAO tokens? <a href="https://Snapshot.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snapshot.org</a>! Snapshot is an off-chain voting tool used to propose and vote on changes to the DAO. It leverages IPFS to store votes.</p><p>A proposal is just a document that lays out some change to the DAO and gives a single choice amongst multiple options in a voting mechanism. Anybody holding the DAO&#x27;s token can vote on a proposal for which result they prefer. For example, someone might create a proposal on Snapshot that a certain person is interviewed as a guest on the podcast. As a <code>$PODC</code> holder, I can navigate to the proposal on <a href="http://Snapshot.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snapshot.org</a> and vote yes or no. The weighting of my vote is proportional to the amount of <code>$PODC</code> I hold.</p><p>A proposal is accepted by the DAO when a certain number of votes is reached (say, two-thirds, or 67%). When a proposal is accepted, it is the responsibility of the multisig signatories to carry out the proposal.</p><p>Importantly, there is an element of trust required for this to work effectively. At the end of the day, the multisig signatories have complete control over the treasury, and they have to be willing to carry out the wishes of the DAO. This risk is mitigated by the nature of the multisig: because it requires multiple signatures, the likelihood of coordination amongst bad-acting signatories is somewhat mitigated. Reputation is on the line, too, so signatories are somewhat incentivized to act in the best interest of the DAO.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="aragon"><strong>Aragon</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#aragon" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>As noted above, Snapshot voting happens off-chain, but on-chain voting is possible. In comparison, <a href="https://aragon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aragon</a> provides on-chain voting. With Aragon, no aspect of the DAO is happening in your web browser. Instead, absolutely everything would be executed as a transaction on the blockchain. In some sense, this makes the DAO more decentralized, but also a little bit less agile and quite a bit more expensive to interact with.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="takeaways"><strong>Takeaways</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#takeaways" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>DAOs are becoming more and more popular, and there is no single playbook for creating a DAO. We are in an ecosystem of DAO tooling. Juicebox, Gnosis, Snapshot, Aragon are composable tools that can be mixed and matched with each other to create the infrastructure that is a single DAO. Each DAO will make different choices about which pieces of tooling and what level of decentralization is appropriate for their project and goals.</p><hr><p>Follow [<a href="https://twitter.com/aeolianeth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@aeolianeth</a>] on Twitter.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/ecosystem">ecosystem</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/guide">guide</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/juicebox-protocol-tokenomics">Juicebox protocol tokenomics</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-11-27T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">November 27, 2021</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/me_jango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1414958948189413395/l89bNR2m_400x400.jpg" alt="Jango"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/me_jango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Jango</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">JuiceboxDAO Contributor</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>In its first funding cycle, each project issues 1,000,000 tokens for each 1 ETH received.</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="level-0">Level 0<a class="hash-link" href="#level-0" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In its simplest form, a Juicebox project can be configured to fundraise and provide refunds. </p><p>Example: I pay 5 ETH into a treasury and receive 5,000,000 tokens, and you pay 5 ETH and receive 5,000,000 tokens. There are now 10 ETH in the treasury and 10,000,000 tokens total. Since I own half of the tokens, I can redeem them to get half of the treasury&#x27;s total – in other words I can get a refund. You can do the same.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="level-1">Level 1<a class="hash-link" href="#level-1" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A reserved rate can be added which will allocate a percentage of the minted token supply to a preprogrammed list of addresses.</p><p>Example: The project sets a 10% reserved rate that goes to the DAO&#x27;s multisig address. I pay 5 ETH into a treasury and receive 4,500,000 tokens, and you pay 5 ETH and receive 4,500,000 tokens. The DAO&#x27;s multisig now has access to 1,000,000 tokens.

I pay 5 ETH into a treasury and receive 5,000,000 tokens, and you pay 5 ETH and receive 5,000,000 tokens.
The treasury now has 10 ETH –  1 ETH is within the target, and the other 9 are considered overflow. I can redeem/burn by tokens to receive my proportion of the overflow, which is 4.5 ETH. The 1 ETH target is still distributable to the project and not accessible to token holders.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="level-3">Level 3<a class="hash-link" href="#level-3" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A redemption bonding curve can be added which reduces the amount of the treasury that can be reclaimed by redeeming tokens. </p><p>Example: The project sets a 50% bonding curve. I pay 5 ETH to the treasury and receive 5,000,000 tokens, and you pay 5 ETH and receive 5,000,000 tokens. Because of the redemption bonding curve, I will only receive ~2.5 ETH if I redeem my tokens. The rest is left to share by those who are holding, so you could now redeem your tokens and get the remaining ~7.5 ETH.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="level-4">Level 4<a class="hash-link" href="#level-4" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A discount rate can be added to decrease the rate of tokens that are minted and distributed when contributions are received over time. </p><p>Example: The project sets a 10% discount rate and a 14 day funding cycle duration.  I pay 5 ETH to the treasury and receive 5,000,000 tokens on day one during the first funding cycle. Fourteen days later during the second funding cycle, you pay 5 ETH and receive 4,500,000 tokens.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="level-5">Level 5<a class="hash-link" href="#level-5" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>It is important to note that a project can change its reserved rate, target, redemption bonding curve, and discount rate on a per-funding cycle basis. Some projects might choose to have no funding cycle duration for the most flexibility, meaning they can reconfigure the project on demand. It is really important to trust the owner of the project because they have a lot of control to shape the tokenomics. </p><p>A project can also set a ballot contract in its funding cycle to create conditions according to which all proposed reconfigurations must abide.</p><p>Example: The project sets a 3-day delay ballot contract. If the project owner wants to reconfigure any funding cycle property, the transaction to do so must be sent at least 3 days before the end of the current funding cycle. If the reconfiguration was made within the 3 days, the next funding cycle will instead be a copy of the current one, and the reconfiguration would be eligible to take effect after that one.</p><p>People can build arbitrary ballot contracts as long as it conforms to <a href="https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v1/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IFundingCycleBallot.sol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IFundingCycleBallot</a>.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/guide">guide</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/overflow">Overflow: A mechanism to refund, ragequit, give cash-back, or offer realizable profits.</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-11-16T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">November 16, 2021</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/me_jango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1414958948189413395/l89bNR2m_400x400.jpg" alt="Jango"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/me_jango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Jango</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">JuiceboxDAO Contributor</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>A project&#x27;s overflowed funds in the Juicebox protocol can serve various purposes depending on the configuration choices the project makes. </p><p>A reminder, overflow is the amount of funds currently in a project&#x27;s Juicebox treasury minus its current funding cycle&#x27;s <code>target</code>, which specifies the amount allowed to be distributed from the treasury to preprogrammed addresses during the cycle. A project&#x27;s token holders can burn their tokens at any point to receive a proportional amount of the project&#x27;s overflow. This proportion can be affected by a <code>bondingCurve</code> also configured per funding cycle. A curve of 100% is a linear proportion.</p><p>Here are outlines of how a project&#x27;s funding cycles might be configured to use its overflow for achieving various treasury designs:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="refund">Refund<a class="hash-link" href="#refund" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Overflow can be used to give all contributors access to their money back in the case of an unsuccessful campaign. </p><p>In the case of ConstitutionDAO, the project&#x27;s first funding cycle is configured with a <code>target</code> of <code>uint256.max</code>, which allows free movement of any funds accumulated in Juicebox into preprogrammed addresses (the Gnosis multisig wallet). It is also set up with a <code>duration</code> of 0, which gives the project&#x27;s owner (also the Gnosis multisig wallet) authority to trigger a new reconfigured funding cycle at any point. All ETH contributed mints a proportional amount of the project&#x27;s tokens for the contributor.</p><p>The multisig could thus reconfigure the project to have a <code>target</code> of 0 and then inject all of its raised funds back into its Juicebox treasury, which would make all funds in the project considered overflow and therefor claimable by token holders. With the <code>bondingCurve</code> at 100%, each token holder could then burn their supply to receive the same amount of ETH they originally put in.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ragequit">Ragequit<a class="hash-link" href="#ragequit" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A project can use its overflow to allow disenchanted token holders to exit and take with them a portion of the treasury&#x27;s funds.</p><p>Only a project&#x27;s overflowed funds in Juicebox are available to be claimed by burning tokens. If a project&#x27;s funds are mostly kept in a multisig (or other contracts/assets), they cannot not be taken into account in the redemption value of a token (changing in V2). A project can thus tune the expected return of ragequitting by injecting liquid funds back into Juicebox, adjusting its <code>target</code> value, and loosing/tightening its bonding curve.</p><p>If a project is spending its raised funds at a faster rate than it is pulling in funds, or if the project&#x27;s rate of token distribution has changed over time, it&#x27;s likely ragequitting via the built in juicebox mechanism won&#x27;t yield the same amount as initially contributed.</p><p><em>Shouts to MolochDAO for coining the term &quot;ragequit&quot;.</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cash-back">Cash-back<a class="hash-link" href="#cash-back" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A project that sells products can use its overflow to give customers the opportunity for cash-back. </p><p>TileDAO, for example, currently sells artwork for 0.16 ETH. When works are minted, the sale price is piped into the TileDAO treasury, minting the project&#x27;s tokens for the buyer in return. TileDAO might want to give its token holders incentive to hold these tokens by giving them utility, perhaps decision making weight in governance, otherwise holders might want to redeem them for some of the project&#x27;s treasury. This redemption would essentially give the buyer of the art some cash back, the value of which determined by several aspects of the project&#x27;s funding cycle choices over time.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="realizable-profits">Realizable profits<a class="hash-link" href="#realizable-profits" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A project can inject funds into its treasury from arbitrary sources, giving all token holders access to them by burning tokens. </p><p>The simplest example here would be a project that gathers funds via a Juicebox project to purchase a thing, then turns around and sells the thing for more than what it paid. The funds from the sale can then be injected back into the Juicebox project for token holders to claim if they choose to do so.</p><hr><p>Consistent through all of these examples are consequential choices that a project can make to offer its community particular treasury designs over time. The address that controls the NFT representing a Juicebox project has the power to make these choices. Whichever EOA or contract stewarding this responsibility on a community&#x27;s behalf should be scrutinized and held accountable to the extent each community sees fit. </p><p>Hopefully what these examples make clear is that the tokens issued by projects using the Juicebox protocol have no intrinsic value. They can, however, be used by projects as a utility for making decisions, the outcomes of which can give them value. It all depends on the choices we make together over time, and the social and algorithmic contracts we use to make these choices binding.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/guide">guide</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"></nav></main></div></div></div></div>
