What’re you up to right now?<a class="hash-link" href="#hi-sage-whatre-you-up-to-right-now" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I just ate a frozen burrito. My boyfriend’s sister owned a little sundry shop which just went outta business so they had groceries for free! Yesterday we went and got like 700 bucks worth of bougie groceries. I have a big thing for frozen burritos.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="haha-im-reminded-of-the-story-of-the-plumber-in-france-people-are-standing-at-the-cathedral-admiring-the-art-and-architecture-and-the-plumber-just-wants-to-go-into-the-catacombs-to-see-how-they-laid-and-routed-their-pipes-you-can-have-anything-and-yet-the-frozen-burrito-seems-to-be-the-winner">Haha. I’m reminded of the story of the plumber in France. People are standing at the cathedral admiring the art and architecture, and the plumber just wants to go into the catacombs to see how they laid and routed their pipes. You can have anything, and yet the frozen burrito seems to be the winner!<a class="hash-link" href="#haha-im-reminded-of-the-story-of-the-plumber-in-france-people-are-standing-at-the-cathedral-admiring-the-art-and-architecture-and-the-plumber-just-wants-to-go-into-the-catacombs-to-see-how-they-laid-and-routed-their-pipes-you-can-have-anything-and-yet-the-frozen-burrito-seems-to-be-the-winner" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In addition to everything else! I also like frozen chicken nuggets, which I’m actually eating right now. Usually I eat pretty healthy but… when you have the option to eat gourmet chicken nuggets—</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="walk-me-through-gourmet-chicken-nuggets">Walk me through “gourmet” chicken nuggets!<a class="hash-link" href="#walk-me-through-gourmet-chicken-nuggets" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Well they’re “organic” so yeah, whatever that means. I would never buy frozen chicken nuggets, but they were there so I figured I may as well grab them. The bougiest thing I got was, hmm…  I got a free thing of 15 dollar fig pomegranate jam.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="you-know-i-was-once-gifted-a-40-dollar-peanut-butter-jar">You know, I was once gifted a 40 dollar peanut butter jar.<a class="hash-link" href="#you-know-i-was-once-gifted-a-40-dollar-peanut-butter-jar" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Holy shit.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="actually-by-a-jb-contributor-do-you-want-to-guess-who">Actually by a JB contributor— do you want to guess who?<a class="hash-link" href="#actually-by-a-jb-contributor-do-you-want-to-guess-who" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Hmm, filipv?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="filipv-yes">Filipv, yes!<a class="hash-link" href="#filipv-yes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>He buys 40 dollar jars of peanut butter?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="he-claims-he-got-it-as-a-gift-i-feel-kinda-guilty-opening-it-truth-be-told">He claims he got it as a gift… I feel kinda guilty opening it truth be told…<a class="hash-link" href="#he-claims-he-got-it-as-a-gift-i-feel-kinda-guilty-opening-it-truth-be-told" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In what world could a bottle of PB be worth 40 dollars?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="haha-i-looked-up-the-brand-it-was-a-nice-hipstery-kind-of-homepage-lots-of-flowery-language-but-when-i-delved-in-i-saw-the-process-was-exactly-the-same-i-mean-its-just-mashing-peanuts">Haha.

How’d you get started with JB, anyway?<a class="hash-link" href="#thats-awesome-howd-you-get-started-with-jb-anyway" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I started back when jango and peri were planning on calling it fountain. It was a similar analogy to JB— a fountain creates overflow. So I was doing a lot of drawings of fountains at first, not full time but juat when I had a chance. Then they decided to change the name to “JuiceBox” and then it started to get really fun. We were spit balling about how web3 is kind of outlawish and definitely not mainstream, so we started thinking about juice, fruit, and little punk fruit, and that turned into Banny being a weird little coding BDSM banana.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-always-wondered-about-the-chokers">I always wondered about the chokers…<a class="hash-link" href="#i-always-wondered-about-the-chokers" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Yeah!

If you met Banny IRL, would you guys get along?<a class="hash-link" href="#fascinating-if-you-met-banny-irl-would-you-guys-get-along" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I think most people would get along with him, except for the squares in the world.

He dresses weird. He may not even be a he, he could be a she, an anything, it’s really just a banana.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="he-sounds-like-a-fun-banana-to-hang-with-whats-something-people-may-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you">He sounds like a fun banana to hang with.

I was a ballet dancer for 18 years, I did a lot of ballet and pointe work— that was fun. I’m really bad at like listening/remembering dance moves and routines/sequences, so I wasn’t ever super competitive but I enjoyed it a lot. I also do like to listen to music really loud and dance in my house.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-kind-of-music-are-you-into">What kind of music are you into?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-kind-of-music-are-you-into" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I basically solely listen to country music.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="favorite-artist">Favorite artist?<a class="hash-link" href="#favorite-artist" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>So many!

What’s something you’re looking forward to?<a class="hash-link" href="#awesome-whats-something-youre-looking-forward-to" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Oh man, well one huge thing is that we’re working on the Bannyverse and that everyone at Wagmi is killing it! Burtula is making super sick backgrounds and animations. You’re writing amazing backstories for all the bannies! Tank and Natasha are building and making the site awesome! And Mieos is doing a killer job directing everything! I can’t wait to launch the site and for everyone to meet and make all the hilarious bannies we’ve got in store!</p><p>Another thing on a IRL level, maybe when gas prices go down, is that my boyfriend and I are planning to take our van out to do a tour and go see some friends in Utah and Idaho and Oregon, and do a dirtbiking trip. It’ll probably go for like a month, but we have some work to do on the van first. The best thing about working for JB is that I can do these things because I work remotely.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/dao">dao</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/interview">interview</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/juicebox">juicebox</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/juicebox-in-the-words-of-johnnyd">Juicebox in the Words of johnnyd</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-06-07T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">June 7, 2022</time> · <!-- -->8 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/realfelixander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1509677708854239233/Bsru0Xks_400x400.jpg" alt="Felixander"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/realfelixander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Felixander</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Community Member</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>“Juicebox in the words of” is a series that highlights JB community members in interview form.

It’s been really good. Some good wins, we think, and some good projects to follow up on. We learned a lot about how to communicate our value proposition and got a lot of good stuff.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-important-heres-the-million-dollar-question-what-have-you-found-is-the-ideal-way-to-communicate-jbs-value-proposition">So important.

I think it’s really important to fish out what a project wants and what needs we’re there to give them. From there we’ll know what JB features that’ll help them the most— whether that be transparency in earning/spending, or the ease of launching an ERC-20 token and having that distributed to people upon contributing. Or whether automating payments out of the treasury and restricting/reconfigurations of that spending are the way they want to go. Those are the key points</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="it-strikes-me-a-scalability-problem-we-seem-to-have-a-boutique-approach-at-the-moment-almost-like-a-concierge-service-as-we-expand-how-do-we-streamline-some-of-that-onboarding-without-losing-that-conversation-with-the-user">It strikes me a scalability problem. We seem to have a boutique approach at the moment, almost like a concierge service. As we expand, how do we streamline some of that onboarding without losing that conversation with the user?<a class="hash-link" href="#it-strikes-me-a-scalability-problem-we-seem-to-have-a-boutique-approach-at-the-moment-almost-like-a-concierge-service-as-we-expand-how-do-we-streamline-some-of-that-onboarding-without-losing-that-conversation-with-the-user" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>You’ve hit the nail on the head, that’s absolutely what we have to focus on. I definitely have ideas around that; mainly I really like the idea of categorizing particular common projects/project types, like NFC Coops, straight up Web3 businesses, or the classic one-time fundraiser. I think having clear resources for these like links to pre-filled templates could be super helpful and useful. Essentially, we want people to come to the site and feel comfortable setting up a project themselves without having someone walking them through it.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="for-sure-out-of-curiosity-what-was-it-like-gallivanting-around-with-zeugh">For sure.

It seems like they don’t quite see the scope of its use. What do you make of that?<a class="hash-link" href="#its-funny-arguably-the-most-powerful-jb-tool-the-treasury-seems-like-a-little-on-the-backburner-for-most-people-it-seems-like-they-dont-quite-see-the-scope-of-its-use-what-do-you-make-of-that" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Yeah exactly, there are so few projects using these treasury tools. I think it should be a big priority of ours to present it in a more understandable way; I’m keen to make it more visible on the front-end too. As great and flexible as the protocol is, it can be a tall order for people to understand.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="okay-now-on-to-your-origin-story-howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-it-changed-since-youve-been-here">Okay, now on to your origin story.

Before JB a group of friends and I started getting into NFTs and we wanted to create a DAO to be an NFT Coop, with the goal being to acquire some of the more expensive NFTs. Aeolian was one of my buddies in that NFT and he found JB and looked at the github, started working a bit on it, and told me about it. After a week or so I started doing the same. It was so exciting, I pretty much quit my job 2 weeks later and said okay, I’m doing this.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="front-end-seems-like-so-cross-disciplinary-youre-juggling-user-interfacedesign-along-with-coding-whats-that-like">Front-end seems like so cross-disciplinary.

Before JB it wasn’t a big part of my job at all. I would just get the designs and make it exactly as I was told. At JB I’ve enjoyed the challenge of just putting yourself in the user’s shoes and making it as smooth and seamless as possible.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thats-the-beauty-of-web3-isnt-it-if-you-want-to-take-something-on-and-you-are-capable-nobody-seems-to-care-whether-you-have-formal-training-degrees-etc">That’s the beauty of web3, isn’t it? If you want to take something on, and you are capable, nobody seems to care whether you have formal training, degrees, etc.<a class="hash-link" href="#thats-the-beauty-of-web3-isnt-it-if-you-want-to-take-something-on-and-you-are-capable-nobody-seems-to-care-whether-you-have-formal-training-degrees-etc" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>For sure, it’s an absolutely beautiful part of web3. I would say it’s even more like that in the software industry than in most other industries. Web3 has taken that to a whole other level. It’s totally about what you can produce right now, not what you did a while back, or what you’re promising you’ll do in the future.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="speaking-of-the-future-whats-the-future-look-like-for-johnnyd">Speaking of the future— what’s the future look like for johnnyD?<a class="hash-link" href="#speaking-of-the-future-whats-the-future-look-like-for-johnnyd" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Front-end! I really like the front-end work process, and I’m becoming more inclined towards the design if anything, which is interesting. As much as I love development, really feel a passion for design building more and more. So yeah, we’ll see where that takes me.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="awesome-okay-lets-get-down-to-brass-tacks-whos-your-favorite-jb-member-and-why-is-it-sage">Awesome.

Sage does some incredible art— that stuff is really inspiring. I remember coming to JB and just loving the vibes so much, there was just something so original about it. Sage created those vibes in Banny, like a character who sets the tone for us. That’s why Sage is my favorite.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="can-you-see-a-future-with-banny-in-the-louvre-tourists-lining-up-just-to-get-a-few-minutes-with-an-original-nft-banny-displayed-on-an-lcd-screen">Can you see a future with Banny in the Louvre?

Then the events themselves are also extremely challenging. I love the lifestyle of being well-rounded as opposed to just hammering away at one thing, and I think triathlons with a bit of gym work is probably the healthiest activity there is. Can’t get enough of it.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fair-enough-it-definitely-sounds-challenging-so-where-are-you-off-to-next-on-your-travels">Fair enough, it definitely sounds challenging!

What’re you up to right now and what’s on your mind?<a class="hash-link" href="#hey-mieos-whatre-you-up-to-right-now-and-whats-on-your-mind" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Hmm… the thing that has been occupying my attention and creativity a lot lately has been this desire to convert the greater portion of juicebox projects from these crowd-funded single-purchase projects to something more like a product or service or longer-term projects that build out and make full use of JB tooling.</p><p>It’s really also about trying to find a way for creators to run creative endeavors on web3 because they believe web3 is where we’re going, but may not be super comfortable with web3 yet. I feel like I’m really hunting down people who I know may be able to bridge this gap and show some excellent JB use cases.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-think-daos-are-still-new-enough-where-the-people-themselves-have-to-be-the-tools-almost-like-fleshy-uis-that-can-help-navigate-doers-who-may-not-be-fluent-or-even-conversational-in-the-web3-world-definitely-not-an-easy-person-to-find">I think DAOs are still new enough where the people themselves have to be the tools, almost like fleshy UIs that can help navigate doers who may not be fluent or even conversational in the web3 world. Definitely not an easy person to find.<a class="hash-link" href="#i-think-daos-are-still-new-enough-where-the-people-themselves-have-to-be-the-tools-almost-like-fleshy-uis-that-can-help-navigate-doers-who-may-not-be-fluent-or-even-conversational-in-the-web3-world-definitely-not-an-easy-person-to-find" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>No, haha, definitely not! We’re stuck in a beautiful moment where V2 is starting to open up an opportunity for non full-web3 nerds, whereas with V1 there really wasn’t much chance for non web3-nerds. V2 is starting to change that and I think that will lead to more great things.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-does-wagmi-fit-into-all-this">How does Wagmi fit into all this?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-does-wagmi-fit-into-all-this" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I think Wagmi has to take a position of palatable education. I think good branding does that. It points people in the right direction for the kind of info they want. I’ve always wanted Wagmi to be more educational, but when we started to do this with V1, V2 was on the horizon so we held off. After all with all the changes coming with V2 it didn’t make sense to produce a lot of content that would all just have to be redone a few months later. Now that V2 is here and coming into its own, we can really go full force into this endeavor.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="for-what-its-worth-when-i-started-as-a-total-jb-n00b-the-wagmi-videos-were-really-the-easiest-entryway-to-me">For what it’s worth, when I started, as a total JB n00b, the Wagmi videos were really the easiest entryway to me.<a class="hash-link" href="#for-what-its-worth-when-i-started-as-a-total-jb-n00b-the-wagmi-videos-were-really-the-easiest-entryway-to-me" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Yeah and that’s what it’s about. We want creatives, people who may be a bit unclear on web3, but who see where its going and recognize its value. And those people will bring their supporters over. Making great content to help ease that transition into web3 is a biggie to attract those people.</p><p>In terms of Wagmi’s future, I’d ultimately love to see Wagmi move away from full-time JB stuff and move more toward helping projects on the platform succeed. We could give these projects a little shove in the creative department, whether by helping them with animations, designing mascots, and who knows what else.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ive-felt-like-jb-high-could-be-a-central-point-of-info-for-newbies-obviously-a-lot-of-that-exists-already-elsewhere-on-the-web-but-do-you-see-any-value-in-really-doing-like-a-web3-crash-course-on-jb-high-to-truly-onboard-a-total-n00b-from-starting-to-finishing-their-first-project-creation">I’ve felt like JB High could be a central point of info for newbies. Obviously a lot of that exists already elsewhere on the web, but do you see any value in really doing like a “web3 crash course” on JB High to truly onboard a total n00b from starting to finishing their first project creation?<a class="hash-link" href="#ive-felt-like-jb-high-could-be-a-central-point-of-info-for-newbies-obviously-a-lot-of-that-exists-already-elsewhere-on-the-web-but-do-you-see-any-value-in-really-doing-like-a-web3-crash-course-on-jb-high-to-truly-onboard-a-total-n00b-from-starting-to-finishing-their-first-project-creation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I don’t think it’s overkill to do that at all, we just have to be clear on our time cost, and we shouldn’t invest too much time if there are more efficient ways to do it. I think a web3 crash course could be done in 2-3 animated shorts plus maybe a page or two on JB High; it’s not a heavy lift.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-it-changed-since-youve-been-there">How’d you get started with JB, and how has it changed since you’ve been there?<a class="hash-link" href="#howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-it-changed-since-youve-been-there" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>From the very beginning, I was trying to figure out from what JB could be. Jango’s take was that JB was a payment terminal, so I was like okay, are we building Stripe for web3? But then he was talking about treasuries, and discount rates and bonding curves, and pre-minting tokens and reserve rates, and I was like man, nobody’s gonna have any idea what this is. When I finally grokked it I was like “Ohhhh, this is what this could be!”</p><p>I saw some possible use cases, and was talking to some of the early guys about what it could do, but I think none of us really grasped it. It was so new and there just wasn’t really a concept you could build off, you really had to understand it for what it was, as something unique, and that took time.</p><p>But before even all that happened, I was working with Sage to figure out the brand and how we can we make this whole JB thing feel cool, and actually one of the first things we messed with was claymation.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-saw-a-claymation-video-floating-around-is-that-one-of-those-early-things">I saw a claymation video floating around! Is that one of those early things?<a class="hash-link" href="#i-saw-a-claymation-video-floating-around-is-that-one-of-those-early-things" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Yeah, that’s one of the first things Wagmi ever did! It was a lot of fun.</p><p>Another biggie early on, actually probably the first thing that came up as important, was starting to think was how could we help people understand what JB could do. So I figured “Oh, I could launch a project on JB and that could serve as an example for people of what to do.”</p><p>So I told Sage, hey, let’s run something like an animated studio/illustration studio out of JB, really as an example of JB’s power, and that was the birth of Wagmi. And it has been an absolutely great example. I’m really glad we did that rather than stay as paid contributors in JB itself. It serves as a great example for how projects can coexist in the space and serve one another.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="was-jb-your-first-jump-into-web3">Was JB your first jump into web3?<a class="hash-link" href="#was-jb-your-first-jump-into-web3" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Yeah, it was! I’ve just always been interested in tech projects and when I got to know jango and peri and they were talking about tech projects I just wanted to hang out and learn, and to try to help in any way I could.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="man-thats-such-a-high-bar-for-a-n00b-to-get-into">Man, that’s such a high bar for a n00b to get into.<a class="hash-link" href="#man-thats-such-a-high-bar-for-a-n00b-to-get-into" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Haha, yeah it was a high bar, I still remember it took me 4 months! I spent 4 months saying the words and having no idea what I was talking about— “Yeah yeah yeah, the payment terminal, and getting ETH out and bonding curve, and the redemption rate,” I had no idea what I was talking about, and then, finally one day it clicked! It was so rewarding, and it validated to me so much of what I had been trying to grasp.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-ran-into-that-in-a-very-dense-philosophy-text-once-that-was-like-that-so-hard-to-grasp-you-wanna-walk-away-since-you-definitely-dont-wanna-stick-around-and-feel-stupid-thats-a-tough-spot-to-be-in">I ran into that in a very dense philosophy text once that was like that. So hard to grasp, you wanna walk away, since you definitely don’t wanna stick around and feel stupid. That’s a tough spot to be in.<a class="hash-link" href="#i-ran-into-that-in-a-very-dense-philosophy-text-once-that-was-like-that-so-hard-to-grasp-you-wanna-walk-away-since-you-definitely-dont-wanna-stick-around-and-feel-stupid-thats-a-tough-spot-to-be-in" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Yeah! Sticking around and feeling stupid sucks. You want to help, you want to chip in, and halfway through a sentence you realize damn, I don’t know what I’m saying, but now I’ve started talking and I gotta finish this sentence, haha. It’s like the brain needs contextual points of knowledge to learn the next thing, and some things are so far away from these basic knowledge nodes that you can’t bridge the concept. Then you’re like “Oh, it’s like Uber for Mcdonalds?” and it clicks all of a sudden. But what if you don’t have that basic script where you have to really put two or three of those nodes together to bridge over to a new concept. Sometimes you have the right teacher and they know that’s the case, and they’ll build that out for you, but otherwise you’re kind of reinventing the wheel in your mind, and for sure that can be so frustrating.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="im-glad-it-clicked-for-you-and-for-me-whos-your-fav-contributor-and-why-is-it-stevie-g">I’m glad it clicked for you (and for me!).

I would say the thing that attracts me to Stevie G is his uncanny ability to come off as hyper-authentic. There’s never a moment where I listen to him that I’m not like, “This dude is so real, he’s like, such a good human.” Regardless of whether or not you are a good human, or you think you are, many times I come off as an asshole—</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="oh-yeah-you-dont-need-to-tell-me-coming-off-like-an-asshole-unintentionally-is-a-lowkey-superpower-of-mine">Oh yeah, you don’t need to tell me, coming off like an asshole unintentionally is a lowkey superpower of mine…<a class="hash-link" href="#oh-yeah-you-dont-need-to-tell-me-coming-off-like-an-asshole-unintentionally-is-a-lowkey-superpower-of-mine" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Hahaha!

Hmm… other than that, as a child I was forced to do Hooked on Phonics, it’s probably not funny for anybody under the age of 35 since it didn’t exist for anybody that young, but like, when I had to do it, it was a joke, it was literally a joke that people would say to diss each other.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-remember-that-it-was-a-schoolyard-way-to-call-people-dumb">I remember that… it was a schoolyard way to call people dumb.<a class="hash-link" href="#i-remember-that-it-was-a-schoolyard-way-to-call-people-dumb" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Right!

I was involved in SharkDAO and I got to meet some of the people there, and got to meet jango who was the lead protocol dev there. Eventually my interest turned primarily to JB. I’ve always been interested in these tools that allow for social integration and JB was right up that alley in terms of tooling that lets people coordinate to create whatever project they want. On top of that they have this X factor which is the spirit of a true DAO— it’s not about VC or cash grabs— and I think that’s really interesting given the last 20 years or so of centralized social development in web2.</p><p>I contributed at JB where I could, did a lot of governance, operations streamlining, starting tye notion library and working on organization. In early 2022 I decided to take a step back, focus a bit more on programming stuff, solidity, NFTs, etc. Over the course of a few months I realized I’m just too fascinated by JB, and especially with V2 coming out and seeing this amazing potential. JB feels like an open source project with a revenue model, which is attracting incredible people from all over the world.</p><p>So I decided to jump back into JB. I put proposal in for trial payout and I’m hoping I can jump back into the team.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="theres-a-lot-of-excitement-around-v2-what-specifically-has-you-interested-in-coming-back">There’s a lot of excitement around V2. What specifically has you interested in coming back?<a class="hash-link" href="#theres-a-lot-of-excitement-around-v2-what-specifically-has-you-interested-in-coming-back" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Two things are drawing me back— tankbottoms, who has been building/adapting stuff related to NFT creation and minting and turning those into tools that can be used more broadly. If it can be pulled off correctly, I think it’ll go way beyond just JB. It’s really revolutionary and applicable in so many different contexts. I feel like I can be useful there in design/code/helping out.</p><p>That’s obviously enabled partly by V2. The treasury management stuff being discussed right now— like creating projects that allow you to diversify the treasury into other tokens, and using JB as mechanism for doing that— is extremely cool. V2 is so open-ended, and part of the lift involved is getting that tooling across to people.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-think-thats-a-biggie-jb-has-so-many-tools-but-i-agree-that-it-may-be-overwhelming-for-a-newbie-coming-onto-the-scene-theres-also-a-kind-of-idea-like-if-you-spotted-a-restaurant-that-served-italian-japanese-greek-and-turkish-food-you-may-think-okay-they-cant-possibly-be-doing-all-that-correct-what-do-you-make-of-that">I think that’s a biggie. JB has so many tools, but I agree that it may be overwhelming for a newbie coming onto the scene. There’s also a kind of idea like, if you spotted a restaurant that served Italian, Japanese, Greek and Turkish food, you may think okay, they can’t possibly be doing all that correct. What do you make of that?<a class="hash-link" href="#i-think-thats-a-biggie-jb-has-so-many-tools-but-i-agree-that-it-may-be-overwhelming-for-a-newbie-coming-onto-the-scene-theres-also-a-kind-of-idea-like-if-you-spotted-a-restaurant-that-served-italian-japanese-greek-and-turkish-food-you-may-think-okay-they-cant-possibly-be-doing-all-that-correct-what-do-you-make-of-that" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Yeah, for sure. What’s great is that JB has really shown that it is aligned with memetic fundraisers in the past. I don’t know if you’d call it product market fit (PMF) yet, but it has the orientation toward PMF with these memetic raises, some of them more enduring than others. Hopefully it can be useful for enduring long term treasury management functions.</p><p>One thing I think about— there’s lot of NFT projects that set aside a portion of sales/royalties to  a treasury (which is sitting in a multisig somewhere). Maybe the collection lost momentum, who knows, but that funding is still hanging around somewhere. I have an assumption that there are dozens or more multisigs that belong to a DAO that have 50-250 ETH sitting in it without a lot of activity. If those things had been run on something like JB, maybe there could have been tools JB would have offered to make sure funds like that were put to use.</p><p>I definitely do agree regarding the interface/tooling offerings— it’ll be interesting to see what happens since JB is one interface right now, and that has value. But ultimately I think we’ll see more interface experimentation. In the past when the Mandarin speakers came in, I was supportive of the idea to create some kind of interface that’s more conducive to that new community group. As JB grows I think we may see things like that.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-do-you-think-pmf-looks-like-for-jb">What do you think PMF looks like for JB?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-do-you-think-pmf-looks-like-for-jb" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I’m most interested in enduring projects that use the protocl as their treasury. I think—and maybe my thinking has evolved on it— but last year as I got to understand JB in greater detail, I felt like there’s two functions for DAOs. One is a place to hold your assets— that’s JB— whether assets are ETH or NFTs or whatever— and the other a place where governance happens. I don’t know that we’ve figured out the most effective way to run governance, but JB governance works extremely well in my opinion. The way JB uses the treasury to handle contributor salary, other expenses, or the network effect when projects pay each other— for instance how JB relates to Wagmi, Canu, Peel, Lexicon Devils— collaborative DAOs end up holding a piece of each other and having a stake in each other’s future. That has potential to have a serious network effect.</p><p>Look at SharkDAO, they have a huge amount of JBX, in their case they don’t really vote on stuff and their JBX isn’t super valuable, but it would be nice to start to see that happen with partner DAOs.</p><p>I think the thing we’re missing is the NFT thing— that’s the key in my opinion to returning revenue over time. Canu, Wagmi, etc., are paid through JB, so they can show how great the network is because they have locked in revenue from the revenue fees JB takes from all projects on the protocol. I think if we could create non-JB originating revenues, that would be fascinating.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="not-to-mention-the-landscape-may-be-changing-a-bit-here-lets-talk-about-soulbound-tokens-sbts-which-may-be-on-the-horizon-the-idea-here-is-tokens-that-are-non-transferable-some-say-good-idea-others-say-its-just-a-way-to-make-resumes-in-web3-what-do-you-make-of-that">Not to mention the landscape may be changing a bit here. Let’s talk about “Soulbound” tokens (SBTs), which may be on the horizon. The idea here is tokens that are non-transferable. Some say good idea, others say it’s just a way to make resumes in web3. What do you make of that?<a class="hash-link" href="#not-to-mention-the-landscape-may-be-changing-a-bit-here-lets-talk-about-soulbound-tokens-sbts-which-may-be-on-the-horizon-the-idea-here-is-tokens-that-are-non-transferable-some-say-good-idea-others-say-its-just-a-way-to-make-resumes-in-web3-what-do-you-make-of-that" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The idea of non-transferable tokens… it’s interesting. I think no matter what in web3, if you’re an amazing code you will probably always get work. But that being said treating SBT’s like a resume can definitely happen too. I have to say I haven’t read the paper yet, so I’m just going off of what I heard floating around the web3 space.</p><p>Long term, there’s a decent argument against it, which is that in ten years I don’t think any of us will be using the same wallet. But overall, I think it’s trying to answer the problem of these membership DAOs. If you base your membership on holding a market-tradable token, the appreciation of the token will ultimately result in the dilution of the quality of the members of your community as people sell.</p><p>Also JokeDAO comes to mind, where if you participate in their competition by submitting a joke, you get voting tokens for the subsequent competition.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="one-time-use-tokens-in-other-words">One-time use tokens in other words.<a class="hash-link" href="#one-time-use-tokens-in-other-words" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Yes exactly.

Tankbottoms is great. There are so many great contributors honestly. If I had to point to anyone in particular, the person I admire most or seek to learn the most from is jango. There are many talented contributors, but jango has the talent I most wish I had— which is real clarity. It doesn’t mean jango knows everything and everyone follows him. It means he has real clarity around orientation to questions. You could call it vision, but that maybe that’s reductive. It’s more like in discussions he’s able to refocus very fluently. And of course being able to travel up and down the stack is incredible. Tankbottoms also is an unbelievable contributor in terms of accumulated experience and raw skill, which is so great. I mean, he’s just turning out stuff that other teams talk about for a year, and tank turns it out like that.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-something-people-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you">What is something people would be surprised to learn about you?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-something-people-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Lately I’ve been doing kickboxing every week with my girlfriend and roommate.

Generally when I want to dive into something, I really wanna get into the nuts/bolts and learn it from the ground up. I finally found myself with the time to do that, and me and a couple friends found this NFT project we liked, and even though we couldn’t really afford to buy the NFT separately, if we pull our funds together… and it was like a lightbulb moment. We thought hey, what about this whole DAO thing happening— what if we make a DAO that buys some NFTs. So I found JB and started poking around, and it was coincidentally the same time that ConstitutionDAO was happening. I was drawn in by the amazing branding of Banny (a banana smoking a joint was just amazing) and the next day I wake up, log into discord, and I see the treasury has grown to like 20 million overnight. Once I saw that and started really thinking about the potential of this thing I immediately dropped everything I was doing and started trying to contribute where I could, especially on the dev side and front-end side. Peri welcomed us with open arms and the rest is history as they say.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="awesome-so-much-talk-lately-about-v2-how-would-you-put-v2-in-perspective-for-someone-not-technically-aware-of-all-the-changes">Awesome. So much talk lately about V2! How would you put V2 in perspective for someone not technically aware of all the changes?<a class="hash-link" href="#awesome-so-much-talk-lately-about-v2-how-would-you-put-v2-in-perspective-for-someone-not-technically-aware-of-all-the-changes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>V2, hmm. When we talk about V2 we’re talking about the protocol itself. Jango, Drgorilla and a bunch of others have identified some tings about V1 which were restrictive, like that projects can only raise money in ETH and not in other currencies, that there’s less flexibility around how they can configure projects to meet their needs, and so on. The protocol guys said let’s start developing V2 and improve it from the ground up, and so the front-end’s job in that is basically to support those new additions. There’s exciting potential use cases, like funding your project through your own NFT launch, or like a project that comes along that says we want to award contributors with an NFT that they can sell on secondary market, and the proceeds of those NFTs will go straight into a JB treasury. Another biggie is supporting multi-currencies— projects accepting stablecoins instead of just ETH. Truthfully we don’t even know all the possibilities that it is hopefully going to open up, which is what makes it all the more exciting.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="im-reminded-of-the-story-of-that-city-planner-in-england-way-back-when-who-had-the-roads-built-twice-as-wide-as-necessary-people-thought-he-was-crazy-but-he-saw-a-future-with-population-explosion-do-you-view-v2-as-built-for-the-realities-of-tomorrow">I’m reminded of the story of that city planner in England way back when, who had the roads built twice as wide as necessary. People thought he was crazy, but he saw a future with population explosion. Do you view V2 as built for the realities of tomorrow?<a class="hash-link" href="#im-reminded-of-the-story-of-that-city-planner-in-england-way-back-when-who-had-the-roads-built-twice-as-wide-as-necessary-people-thought-he-was-crazy-but-he-saw-a-future-with-population-explosion-do-you-view-v2-as-built-for-the-realities-of-tomorrow" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Haha, I super admire anyone that can have that kind of forethought and conviction in their idea of the future. When you’re building a protocol as the ecosystem saw with V1, it enables a set of use cases which, in the case of V1, proved to be successful with big fundraisers that make big volume in a short amount of time. Look at the internet– such a non-restrictive, base-level protocol, and look at it now. The creators of the internet would have had no idea that it would become what it is now. Not unlike JB with this website of this smoking banana that enables millions of dollars of fundraising.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="theres-been-this-wonderful-discussion-about-compensation-lately-where-does-a-dao-strike-a-balance-between-compensating-members-and-staying-lean-for-a-down-the-line-bigger-payout">There’s been this wonderful discussion about compensation lately. Where does a DAO strike a balance between compensating members and staying lean for a down-the-line bigger payout?<a class="hash-link" href="#theres-been-this-wonderful-discussion-about-compensation-lately-where-does-a-dao-strike-a-balance-between-compensating-members-and-staying-lean-for-a-down-the-line-bigger-payout" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>It’s really hard. Like someone said in that thread on compensation— I don’t remember who— but comparing people based on a number is just not healthy, right? That’s what people don’t like about traditional corporate life, and that’s why people find themselves in web3 and crypto. They want to escape that world and operate in a space that lets them do what interests them the most. In terms of how to think about it from a first-principles perspective, which I’m trying to do, let’s start with startups. I don’t think the startup model is perfect by any means– it probably disproportionately rewards the founders more than early builders. So that’s not exactly a blueprint for us either.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="its-just-so-complicated-right-so-many-smart-people-and-no-one-has-been-able-to-find-that-holy-grail-answer">It’s just so complicated right?

And drawing from the corporate world and those structures probably is not the right way to go about it either. I’m not a crypto/web3 maximalist in that sense though, I do think people can learn things from those who have come before us, but we’re here to make our own rules and to do what makes sense for us and what leads to the most amazing ecosystem that we can possibly build. That’s what we’re all here to do. The fact that that thread exists and other threads like it exist is a real testament to this community because we’re driven and passionate about figuring this stuff out. That, in my opinion, is the sign of a really healthy community.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="no-egos-can-be-around-in-this-right-how-come-egos-dont-seem-to-clash-more-in-these-situations">No egos can be around in this right– how come egos don’t seem to clash more in these situations?<a class="hash-link" href="#no-egos-can-be-around-in-this-right-how-come-egos-dont-seem-to-clash-more-in-these-situations" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>There’s something about JB, or the way that the community presents itself, whether on socials or within the discord, that it leads to a certain type of person sticking around. People are sufficiently motivated at JB. When teams break apart and things don’t happen it’s because people gave up on figuring out how to make it work. Everyone here recognizes the opportunity we have in front of us, to build this amazing thing and a solid foundation for us to all go forward. It’s a recognition that if we can really sit down and work all this stuff out we’re really gonna be able to build amazing things.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="do-you-think-the-jb-runway-threatened-by-the-compensation-models-we-have-now-jb-never-had-any-vc-coming-in-so-how-do-you-reconcile-that">Do you think the JB runway threatened by the compensation models we have now?

We really do have to think about this stuff. We have to sit down and think about it from a first-principles perspective, rather than approaching it in the traditional way of doing these things.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-about-the-workflow-over-time-problem-ie-what-happens-when-your-job-drops-off-in-work-to-do-because-you-executed-the-task-but-youre-still-getting-this-big-recurring-payout">What about the workflow over time problem– ie, what happens when your job drops off in work to do because you executed the task, but you’re still getting this big recurring payout?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-about-the-workflow-over-time-problem-ie-what-happens-when-your-job-drops-off-in-work-to-do-because-you-executed-the-task-but-youre-still-getting-this-big-recurring-payout" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>That’s the biggie, you’ve hit the nail on the head. One model we’ve stewarded is that the front-end team has broken out into its own treasury in Peel, and that allows us to be more intentional with how we fund projects. It really allows two things: we can onboard quickly those who we think are really good, and we can also understand their skill set right away. We know what we’re looking for and the broader DAO doesn’t have to go in and make a decision on every single recurring payout proposal that comes through that affects the front-end. That’s one model that’s been working for us, but these things are all emerging, and that what makes me super excited to be here in JB and in web3.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="got-it-okay-lets-get-down-to-brass-tacks-whos-your-favorite-jb-member-and-why-is-it-jango">Got it. Okay, let’s get down to brass tacks.

I’m just gonna quote it here:</p><p><em>“i like hangin with folks that can be fluid between bullshitting and manifesting, fluid between appreciating beauty and ugly, fluid between conversation and silence, fluid between humor and practicality, fluid between been in awe of everything and focusing on the next idea in front of us. I&#x27;m attracted as fuck to people with big imaginations who make moves towards them.”</em></p><p>That was like such an amazing statement because it’s really hard to find people who are <em>your</em> people. I feel like my people are this: people who strike that balance between brilliance and focus, but also are able to laugh at the ridiculousness of life, and so I guess when I read that I was like damn, I will definitely be vibing here for many years.</p><p>But my homies at Peel definitely need a huge shoutout. This is the dream team and I&#x27;m super lucky to be a part of it.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-something-that-people-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you">What’s something that people would be surprised to learn about you?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-something-that-people-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Hmm… I don’t really know. I guess one thing is that I started programming very late, and I actually always wanted to be a film composer— writing music for movies. That’s what I was doing before becoming a software engineer. Through high school I was pretty much all about music; I played piano and a bunch of other instruments and I got really into writing music for film, and I thought I would take that road. Eventually I kind of just realized it wasn’t coming from a place of pure passion and excitement. I realized as a musician you have to write music you don’t care to write oftentimes, and take jobs that don’t interest you at all. So I looked for another avenue and it was kind of just random how it happened: I went to university for some unrelated degree and fell in love with programming and comp sci along the way.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/dao">dao</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/interview">interview</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/juicebox">juicebox</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/juicebox-in-the-words-of-0xstvg">Juicebox in the Words of 0xSTVG</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-05-20T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">May 20, 2022</time> · <!-- -->8 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/realfelixander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1509677708854239233/Bsru0Xks_400x400.jpg" alt="Felixander"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/realfelixander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Felixander</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Community Member</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>“Juicebox in the words of” is a series that highlights JB community members in interview form.

I learned about DAOs through Rare Pizzas and this guy named snax— who I gotta give a shoutout to ‘cause he’s the one who introduced me to DAOs— was buying free pizzas on pizza day. It was me and him and 2 other peeps on Clubhouse, and I was like this is stupid, no way this is gonna happen. As I got more comfortable in the DAO space, I eventually found my way to SharkDAO. I had started seeing these SharkDAO logos and I figured hey, I have a printing shop, I should make some hoodies with logos on them to give away, and I did (and they were expensive!). Jango and nicholas were people who helped guide me through sending out those hoodies, and so I got to know them and got to know JB. I decided to start making some JB clothing with graphics as well, and eventually I got put together with Zeugh and the talk was about community. I started helping wherever help was needed, like with governance, moving proposals along as they were coming in, etc. Eventually filipv jumped in and we started tag-teaming it and doing the podcast, which ran for a while.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="filipv-is-great-is-it-fair-to-call-you-two-the-gruesome-twosome">Filipv is great.

I would definitely say I’ve learned a ton from him and I think he would say the same. Every once in a while we’ll pick up the phone and call each other and just say “Hey, how you doin’?”.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-see-you-as-this-onboarding-wizard-where-did-that-start">I see you as this onboarding wizard, where did that start?<a class="hash-link" href="#i-see-you-as-this-onboarding-wizard-where-did-that-start" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>It’s definitely a roll I’ve grown comfortable doing. I remember doing onboarding with MoonDAO and Slice, and eventually then for JB. It’s also interesting that that sort of merged into this weird testing and feedback roll too. I found myself in the front-end chat more and more (I don’t know if I’m providing value there– I hope I am!) to try to test various things, launch projects on test net, find obscure bugs that are here and there and provide suggestions/feedback based on what the onboarding calls are giving me, so it’s kind of become a merged roll. Being in that close proximity to the user gives a lot of great insight and perspective.</p><p>I also think there needs to be a shield between the regular user and developers. I’m very adamant that there needs to be some distance there. I’ve always appreciated jango saying we’re all builders at JB, but let’s be honest, they’re (the devs) are the builders– the developers on the JB protocol side and the Peel Team, they’re really building and everyone else is providing support. Since I joined JB I’ve always felt the need to kind of protect the jangos of JB because they’re so hyper focused that distractions can lead to mistakes, and that can be a big problem. I think a lot of organizations should take on that approach, to be honest, to make sure those core builders are shielded from the basic questions that other contributors can answer. I feel like that’s where I slid right in, I can answer those questions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="im-reminded-of-high-level-athletes-and-how-theyre-trained-the-trainer-almost-has-to-take-a-caretaker-role-ensuring-that-distractionsobstacles-are-cleared-so-that-the-athlete-can-do-what-they-do-perform">I’m reminded of high level athletes and how they’re trained.

It’s all about minimizing distraction. It’s interesting that you bring up athletics; I was a former athlete and after that have been involved in high level training— olympics, NCAA athletes— and the one thing I’ve carried on in my life moving into JB and other things is to eliminate distractions and be in the moment. If you are distracted about the outcome of something, you’re taking away energy from the task that you’re actually doing, and in athletics that could be the difference between a win and a loss, a championship and coming in second. It sounds super corny but launching new extensions has become that for me– that’s the championship, we gotta get there, how do we get there, how do we stay focused are the questions I have bouncing around in my head. I’ve always been an idea person— someone who can really thrive in environments where we’re talking about ideas— and I’ve always been good at that I felt, and JB is this crazy environment where people take ideas and build off of it into something else. It’s like a dream come true.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="there-almost-seems-to-be-a-hippy-spirit-at-jb-people-are-just-so-open-im-thinking-of-the-compensation-discussion-from-a-few-weeks-ago-just-an-open-discussion-no-one-at-each-others-throats">There almost seems to be a hippy spirit at JB– people are just so open. I’m thinking of the compensation discussion from a few weeks ago. Just an open discussion, no one at each other’s throats.<a class="hash-link" href="#there-almost-seems-to-be-a-hippy-spirit-at-jb-people-are-just-so-open-im-thinking-of-the-compensation-discussion-from-a-few-weeks-ago-just-an-open-discussion-no-one-at-each-others-throats" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Yeah, especially with a topic that’s been so sensitive our whole lives– we don’t talk about salary IRL, and to have this open dialogue is special. More so to have the validation that what you’re providing is worth the payout that you’re receiving– there’s no better feeling than that. Having the support of the community has been an amazing feeling for me. People don’t realize how important that is to me– to my personal being. It’s quite an experience and one that I don’t take for granted.</p><p>Regarding compensation, if you don’t pay the people who are irreplaceable, they’re gonna go somewhere else. I think that’s an important point. There’s also people within the DAO that are just completely connected to the DAO itself, like if jango leaves, or Drgorilla leaves, what is JB, or Peel, or what even happens to JB?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fair-question">Fair question.<a class="hash-link" href="#fair-question" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I’ll tell ya right now– if jango decides to do another project, I would ask him if I can go with him. You just can’t replace certain people. So if you don’t pay them, they’re gonna be gone. All that said, I do think we need to be aware that we don’t have unlimited resourced. At the same time I think there’s enough people in the DAO that aren’t necessarily leaning on JB for all their bills/everything they do. So if there’s an emergency situation where people have to back off/reduce payout, I think we’ll see that happen.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-the-lack-of-assholes-and-mentally-checked-out-people-at-juicebox">Why the lack of assholes and mentally checked-out people at Juicebox?<a class="hash-link" href="#why-the-lack-of-assholes-and-mentally-checked-out-people-at-juicebox" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I think because everyone at JB right now has proven their value, and people who haven’t don’t stay around for very long; they weed themselves out. I think there’s also a level of respect from each person that everybody kind of has each other’s back. If you come in and try to take advantage of the DAO, I think the community can read that like a book because we all had to pay our dues. Everyone who’s being paid recurring payouts has been told no at least once– that’s a common denominator we all have. I think when everyone’s gone through that there’s a level of respect and community, which you see in how we treat each other in our day-to-day.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="for-sure-okay-switching-gears-who-is-your-favorite-contributor-and-why-is-it-zeugh">For sure!

I’ve worked closest with jango and filipv probably, but I’ve gotten to know the peel team a bit more and I’ve really enjoyed them asking me for feedback/allowing me to provide feedback. Right now I couldn’t answer who, I just love working with jango and filip– they definitely help me out and give me a strong feeling of purpose.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-something-somebody-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you">What’s something somebody would be surprised to learn about you?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-something-somebody-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I think the biggest surprise would be… I have four kids! That is something that actually helps me with what I’m doing at JB– I’m good with time management/organization, and can make time for everything. My oldest son is really active with sports, so I’m juggling a lot, but even on the sidelines I’m always on the discord.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/dao">dao</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/interview">interview</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/juicebox">juicebox</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/juicebox-in-the-words-of-zeugh">Juicebox in the Words of Zeugh</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-05-14T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">May 14, 2022</time> · <!-- -->12 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/realfelixander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1509677708854239233/Bsru0Xks_400x400.jpg" alt="Felixander"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/realfelixander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Felixander</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Community Member</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>“Juicebox in the words of” is a series that highlights JB community members in interview form.

DAOs amazed me and i had my eyes on crypto for a while… but when I found out DAOs existed I was very excited to work with them. I joined a discord server and got involved with Tiles DAO, and eventually just explored more. I wasn’t in JB way at the beginning, but I did join in the first week after release. When the question came up that a community manager was needed, I put my name out there. I had never been a comm manager per se, but had been doing comm management for other products I was helping release and so I figured I’d take it on, got voted in, and hit the ground running. I started</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-youre-an-og">So you’re an OG.<a class="hash-link" href="#so-youre-an-og" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I joined in week 1 of JB, back at FC1. Although regarding crypto as a whole, I’m pretty much a newbie. JB was the first project I really got involved in and put my hands on.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wow-thats-nuts-youve-seen-the-evolution-of-jb-from-start-to-right-now-would-you-say-its-unrecognizable">Wow, that’s nuts— you’ve seen the evolution of JB from start to right now. Would you say it’s unrecognizable?<a class="hash-link" href="#wow-thats-nuts-youve-seen-the-evolution-of-jb-from-start-to-right-now-would-you-say-its-unrecognizable" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>From the beginning? I wouldn’t say unrecognizable because I think some of the core values of transparency, building out in the open, and great vibes have been around since day one. The core values have not changed, and that’s beautiful.</p><p>I think of it like a sapling and tree, just as they are different, they are also the same.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-would-you-describe-your-role-at-jb">How would you describe your role at JB?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-would-you-describe-your-role-at-jb" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A confusing one, firstly, but also a very interesting one. Rarely are two days the same. There is a lot of time spent online in chats and severs, whether the Chinese chats to try to understand community issues, or in other servers to learn new tools they’re using, practices they have, and how they engage/reward/manage a sustainable growth.</p><p>Lately we’ve pushed hard on trying to automate governance with guys like filipv, Phytann, jigglyjamz, lazervike and others, and Canu has been heavily involved in this as well.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-has-it-been-like-working-with-the-chinese-community-and-their-role-at-jb">What has it been like working with the Chinese community, and their role at JB?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-has-it-been-like-working-with-the-chinese-community-and-their-role-at-jb" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>It’s one of the better things that happened to JB ever, but at the same time definitely one of the biggest challenges. Bringing our Chinese members together in a governance process where we all get the power to decide what we do is a complex thing, but it’s exactly what makes us so critical and diverse in what we build. We have to do good stuff– not sensibly good to my taste or American or European tastes, or to Chinese tastes, but it has to be good stuff across the board. That’s very challenging to pull off, but at the same time we’re all a part of the community.</p><p>When the community first came, I remember I would jump in there with google translate to try to make sense of the chats going on in discord. Man, it was so suddenly so many new members, and we had to try to reach out and make those connections. It was an exiting and also exhausting time, especially since google translate can only do so much. I do have to say one of the members who has been a killer and God in moderating the Chinese community, getting them informed and engaged, is twodam. That guy is a beast and I appreciate him so much.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-idea-of-you-sitting-in-discord-with-google-translate-and-trying-to-understand-chinese-is-absolutely-hilarious-to-me">The idea of you sitting in Discord with google translate and trying to understand Chinese is absolutely hilarious to me.<a class="hash-link" href="#the-idea-of-you-sitting-in-discord-with-google-translate-and-trying-to-understand-chinese-is-absolutely-hilarious-to-me" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Let me tell you— now we have the translate bot. It automatically translates. But that day when we got that huge influx of members, it was 3am and my phone starting beeping, beeping, beeping, and I was like ok, silent mode, I’m not working tonight, this is my one night off.</p><p>But it didn’t stop! So I got back to my comp and there were more than 1k new members, all of them Mandarin speakers, and all were over every channel– and up to that day we didn’t have a single Mandarin channel, so I spent the whole night with google translate writing FAQs, basic guides on how to solve the most common questions, translated hundreds of Q’s and ranked them with what were the most relevant answers, and I think it was nicholas and someone else who was in the twitter spaces that joined and were able to pitch in and help. Shout out to those guys and everyone who helped early on with that, it was such a huge task and everyone stepped up. Eventually we even found some university students from the US that we knew who were Chinese and we asked them to translate asap, and that helped a lot too. Now we have really amazing translator teams, the of course the amazing twodam who kills it every day, and so we’ve found a good stride.</p><p>Twodam is amazing, I can’t say enough good things. He ended up in this position of managing the greatest share of governance (by population) and is doing it incredibly well. I’m about convinced that twdam is a team– not a guy, a whole team– because the guy does contracts, community, translates, I mean he’s absolutely incredible.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="where-are-all-the-assholes-at-jb">Where are all the assholes at JB?<a class="hash-link" href="#where-are-all-the-assholes-at-jb" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>That’s a very good question, actually. The main thing on that that fascinates me is that I’ve spent countless hours crunching analytics data on our conversations, running our bots, and so far I haven’t found them either. Idk why, but they are just not around I guess. The funny thing is we’re in the crypto space— people being obnoxious is like breakfast, but somehow at JB we don’t attract these kinds of people.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-something-somebody-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you">What’s something somebody would be surprised to learn about you?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-something-somebody-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I was a comp sci undergrad for 3 years, that’s when I first heard about crypto, and even so it took me 5 years to ever engage in my first transaction (which was in bitcoin!) to actually get into crypto because I was completely against burning the amazon. I was a very critical person of crypto for a good while. I was misinformed.</p><p>I get addicted to hobbies; 2 years ago I was living in a small house in the middle of the woods. I spent about one year living there, talking to my cats or the monkeys who would come to try to steal my food. I was developing digital products and tending to the gardens since I love gardening. I loved the nature, the no-plastic environment, just me and plants, no eating meat. That passed now, I’m back to the animal eating part of life and living around big buildings and concrete and using plastic bags, but that was definitely a life-changing part of my last few years.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-what-changed-the-amazon-can-just-burn-to-the-ground">So what changed? The amazon can just burn to the ground?<a class="hash-link" href="#so-what-changed-the-amazon-can-just-burn-to-the-ground" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I stopped listening to the news and started reading some articles.  After you read the numbers/data you understand that that’s not what’s happening. I was living in the middle of nature trying to find out how possible it was for someone living in society to have the smallest impact in nature– that was the goal of going there– to see how simple/non-violent towards nature I could live without leaving behind civilization and a modern world. I started reading everything I could in every area, so I learned a huge amount and cleared up a lot of misconceptions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fascinating-whos-your-fav-contributor-and-why-is-it-zom_bae">Fascinating. Who’s your fav contributor, and why is it Zom_Bae?<a class="hash-link" href="#fascinating-whos-your-fav-contributor-and-why-is-it-zom_bae" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Haha. I think this gets me into a tight spot here. Although Zom_Bae is terrific, I don’t think I can give her the prize without sharing it with filipv and twodam. I will not even include jango in this one just because that is obvious.</p><p>I can’t choose man, I have the blessing of a very amazing team to work with. If I had to pick, I would share my favorite contributor in four people– Filip, Jango, Twodam, and Zom_Bae. If I had to pick one, I’d go with Zom_Bae. She’s amazing. And the red rocket banny pfp! Zom_Bae does wonders in lots of micro areas around JB community - I would not trust anyone more than her nowadays to be the one who receives and onboards both partners and community members, contributor-wannabes, and everyone in between who needs guidance to navigate our complex environment.</p><p>jango has always been a steward for good culture, has always been bringing some perspectives of open criticism/honest debate since the beginning.</p><p>Filip is a monster– a complete gigabrain going from governance to some automation here and there and finding good minds to help every single area he touches– there’s not an issue I don’t se him going around. Twodam I’ve talked about more than anyone in this inteveriew– it’s well deserved. Bridging two different communities while also building data queries to better observe community trends, and making it look effortless, it’s just amazing…</p><p>But then there’s Mieos and Sage with WAGMI studios and all the vibes– Sage is definitely underrated! A huge shout-out to her and the vibes that we get from Banny and that we get from all the juicy fruits that she brings to life with her art. Banny’s something else.</p><p>Nicholas, filipv, unicorn and 0xSTVG are fucking rocking it, doing amazing at governance issues, really taking the helm on things.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="and-how-about-that-awesome-guy-who-writes-the-banny-histories-huh">And how about that awesome guy who writes the Banny histories, huh?<a class="hash-link" href="#and-how-about-that-awesome-guy-who-writes-the-banny-histories-huh" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>But he’s just in the house, I mean he’s around here and there... I’ll mention him maybe in the next one. Haha.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="okay-no-hard-feelings-besides-feeding-wild-monkeys-do-you-have-any-other-interesting-hobbies">Okay, no hard feelings.

I am the apex of ADHD in a human being. That’s why I tend to work in the night because everyone else is sleeping and that’s less things to get distracted with. I’m kind of a workaholic; I engage a good part of my hobbies like they’re work. I played (semi-professionaly) League of Legends for a while. Very low-tier stuff though.</p><p>I love gardening. I used to have an ant farm; I would catch ant queens in mating season and I started my own ant farm. I raised some ants.</p><p>My hobby is changing hobbies– I have 3-month sprints where I have hyper-focus in something, study a lot and research a lot, get super nerdy, and then I move on to the next thing. I’ve been through organic chemistry– making my own hygiene products. Star wars– reading all I could in the expanded universe. Wicca magic. Cocktails. Making events (very close to community management)! And more to come = )</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thats-awesome-whats-the-favorite-thing-youre-looking-forward-to">That’s awesome. What’s the favorite thing you’re looking forward to?<a class="hash-link" href="#thats-awesome-whats-the-favorite-thing-youre-looking-forward-to" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I’ll have to split the answer in two. The first - watching how crypto changes the world. I’m gonna play a part and I want to play the best part I can. I used to say in my twitter, “I am here to make sure the next big social network is not owned by a corporation, but is co-owned”. I want to see the power of open data, public ledgers, collective ownership over the digital assets that currently rule over people’s days most of the time, and so much more. I want to watch as that unfolds and try to play a part, and I think it will happen in a massive way.</p><p>As for myself, I’m really really keen to creating those bridges between people building stuff and people that need stuff built. I’ll be going nomad for a while and traveling to try to find a way to get a local communities to organize and find solutions through the tech they’re creating. Local communities are powerful and we’re finally at a point where digital communities are also hitting that kind of strength. If we can merge local and digital communities we can really change things. When the people making products, the politicians making promises, etc., are also the people who are living in a community, they can’t just say they’ll do things and not do them. Suddenly there is accountability, and things get better. I want to build a solar-punk future. It sounds crazy, but I used to say, “I’m not crazy, I’m just hopeful.”</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/dao">dao</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/interview">interview</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/juicebox">juicebox</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/juicebox-in-the-words-of-drgorilla">Juicebox in the Words of DrGorilla</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-05-06T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">May 6, 2022</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/realfelixander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1509677708854239233/Bsru0Xks_400x400.jpg" alt="Felixander"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/realfelixander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Felixander</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Community Member</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>“Juicebox in the words of” is a series that highlights JB community members in interview form.

I’ve been in software development for a minute, and I met some anons who wanted to do this public good DAO, which is now called MovementDAO. It’s part seeding start-ups, part non-profit, part social movements.  In researching platforms to work with I found two which I liked the most, OpenLaw’s TributeDAO Framework and Juicebox. </p><p>TributeDAO we updated all the tooling and added DeFi, and at the end felt it was not as accessible as we would have liked. We also took Juicebox forked it and launched it on Polygon (where Matic is used), which was more what we were looking for.  However, we are not the kind of cats to fork and do stuff, its open source and its fair game, but we contribute, add value and divide up the work, so it seemed right to contribute to helping through v2.  </p><p>One place it was mentioned where we could help was figure out the BannyVerse situation. I pinged Wagmi’s Mieos and started collaborating with constructing Banny to be mintable, worked on the TokenUriResolver how the veBannys were going to be selected, and planning on the BannyVerse would unfold NFT-wise. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thats-fascinating-you-seem-to-be-well-versed-on-the-technical-side-of-this-stuff-in-your-opinion-how-do-daos-protect-themselves-from-bad-actorssabotage"><strong>That’s fascinating, you seem to be well-versed on the technical side of this stuff. In your opinion, how do DAO’s protect themselves from bad actors/sabotage?</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#thats-fascinating-you-seem-to-be-well-versed-on-the-technical-side-of-this-stuff-in-your-opinion-how-do-daos-protect-themselves-from-bad-actorssabotage" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A few DAOs have added a veto contract or function in existing contracts that can veto any pending proposals.  This can be provided to a law firm, also called service provider, or retained by the founders until they revoke the right on chain at a later date. In other words, it’s designed to ensure nothing crazy happens.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="interesting-it-seems-like-that-mechanism-kind-of-runs-against-the-philosophy-of-what-a-dao-is-doesnt-it-how-do-you-strike-a-balance-between-control-and-decentralization">Interesting. It seems like that mechanism kind of runs against the philosophy of what a DAO is, doesn’t it?

This whole space is a one large expensive experiment and so you really don’t know what may happen, so its safe to be prudent.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-always-think-of-daocrypto-time-similar-to-dog-years-and-aging-like-one-month-of-time-in-a-dao-has-gotta-be-at-least-6-months-or-a-year-at-a-regular-irl-company-you-and-i-of-course-both-help-as-contributors-to-wagmi-productions-how-would-you-describe-your-role-at-jb-and-wagmi-after-this-first-6-weeks-or-so">I always think of DAO/Crypto time similar to dog-years and aging: like one month of time in a DAO has gotta be at least 6 months or a year at a regular IRL company.

I wrote the Juicebox TokenURI Resolver for the veBanny and make sure the composite Banny and appropriate metadata are deployed on IPFS. Additionally and more importantly, when Juicebox token holders go to stake their Banny and enter the Bannyverse, I aim to enable the experience to mint a unique Banny with anything from Hattori Hanzo to AK-47. A banana has got to defend himself. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-always-ask-about-where-all-the-assholes-are-it-seems-like-so-many-talented-people-working-together-should-bring-a-clash-of-egos-where-are-the-assholes"><strong>I always ask about where all the assholes are, it seems like so many talented people working together should bring a clash of egos.

I also think people who stick around are very talented, the Notion docs do a pretty good job about making it clear that you have to contribute before seeking a one-time or reoccurring payout.  All the contributors are pretty cool about their talent. And that kind of sets the atmosphere.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="between-you-and-me-and-the-rest-of-the-internet-whos-your-favorite-contributor-and-why-is-it-mieos">Between you and me and the rest of the internet, who’s your favorite contributor, and why is it Mieos?<a class="hash-link" href="#between-you-and-me-and-the-rest-of-the-internet-whos-your-favorite-contributor-and-why-is-it-mieos" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I think WAGMI makes it clear you can add a lot of value even if it’s not code. WAGMI’s pixel ninjas, 60 Minutes style interviews, and the enabling of the BannyVerse reinforces that throughout whatever the problem, we are all here to have fun; and reminds us all to no take yourself too seriously, and that says a lot. Mieos is very humble, even though he’s been around in the space for a long time and basically the OG JB whale. He’s pretty rad.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-a-project-within-or-outside-of-jb-that-youre-really-looking-forward-to-in-the-future">What’s a project (within or outside of JB) that you’re really looking forward to in the future?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-a-project-within-or-outside-of-jb-that-youre-really-looking-forward-to-in-the-future" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>MovementDAO, and the future of Juicebox v2 are both things that I am working on and that I am looking forward to enabling. We are all learning every day how things work and willing to change it up, but I want to understand some fundamental parts of what makes Juicebox successful not for just raising funds but to getting people to operate treasuries transparently. We (both JB v2 and MovementDAO) want to enable this with endowments, NFT businesses, start-ups, liquidity pools into a well orchestrated decentralized protocol. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-something-people-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you">What’s something people would be surprised to learn about you?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-something-people-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I don’t know, hmm… I lived in a monastery!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/dao">dao</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/interview">interview</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/blog/tags/interview/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div></div>
