Read on to learn a bit about this erstwhile contributor-turned-vagabond, his aspirations at JB upon his return, and what his plans are for the future.</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-it-changed-since-youve-been-here">How’d you get started with JB and how has it changed since you’ve been here?<a class="hash-link" href="#howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-it-changed-since-youve-been-here" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I found Juicebox originally in June/July of 2021, and I was one of the people who came in through the SharkDAO door. I was involved in SharkDAO and I got to meet some of the people there, and got to meet jango who was the lead protocol dev there. Eventually my interest turned primarily to JB. I’ve always been interested in these tools that allow for social integration and JB was right up that alley in terms of tooling that lets people coordinate to create whatever project they want. On top of that they have this X factor which is the spirit of a true DAO— it’s not about VC or cash grabs— and I think that’s really interesting given the last 20 years or so of centralized social development in web2.</p><p>I contributed at JB where I could, did a lot of governance, operations streamlining, starting tye notion library and working on organization. In early 2022 I decided to take a step back, focus a bit more on programming stuff, solidity, NFTs, etc. Over the course of a few months I realized I’m just too fascinated by JB, and especially with V2 coming out and seeing this amazing potential. JB feels like an open source project with a revenue model, which is attracting incredible people from all over the world.</p><p>So I decided to jump back into JB. I put proposal in for trial payout and I’m hoping I can jump back into the team.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="theres-a-lot-of-excitement-around-v2-what-specifically-has-you-interested-in-coming-back">There’s a lot of excitement around V2. What specifically has you interested in coming back?<a class="hash-link" href="#theres-a-lot-of-excitement-around-v2-what-specifically-has-you-interested-in-coming-back" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Two things are drawing me back— tankbottoms, who has been building/adapting stuff related to NFT creation and minting and turning those into tools that can be used more broadly. If it can be pulled off correctly, I think it’ll go way beyond just JB. It’s really revolutionary and applicable in so many different contexts. I feel like I can be useful there in design/code/helping out.</p><p>That’s obviously enabled partly by V2. The treasury management stuff being discussed right now— like creating projects that allow you to diversify the treasury into other tokens, and using JB as mechanism for doing that— is extremely cool. V2 is so open-ended, and part of the lift involved is getting that tooling across to people.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-think-thats-a-biggie-jb-has-so-many-tools-but-i-agree-that-it-may-be-overwhelming-for-a-newbie-coming-onto-the-scene-theres-also-a-kind-of-idea-like-if-you-spotted-a-restaurant-that-served-italian-japanese-greek-and-turkish-food-you-may-think-okay-they-cant-possibly-be-doing-all-that-correct-what-do-you-make-of-that">I think that’s a biggie. JB has so many tools, but I agree that it may be overwhelming for a newbie coming onto the scene. There’s also a kind of idea like, if you spotted a restaurant that served Italian, Japanese, Greek and Turkish food, you may think okay, they can’t possibly be doing all that correct. What do you make of that?<a class="hash-link" href="#i-think-thats-a-biggie-jb-has-so-many-tools-but-i-agree-that-it-may-be-overwhelming-for-a-newbie-coming-onto-the-scene-theres-also-a-kind-of-idea-like-if-you-spotted-a-restaurant-that-served-italian-japanese-greek-and-turkish-food-you-may-think-okay-they-cant-possibly-be-doing-all-that-correct-what-do-you-make-of-that" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Yeah, for sure. What’s great is that JB has really shown that it is aligned with memetic fundraisers in the past. I don’t know if you’d call it product market fit (PMF) yet, but it has the orientation toward PMF with these memetic raises, some of them more enduring than others. Hopefully it can be useful for enduring long term treasury management functions.</p><p>One thing I think about— there’s lot of NFT projects that set aside a portion of sales/royalties to  a treasury (which is sitting in a multisig somewhere). Maybe the collection lost momentum, who knows, but that funding is still hanging around somewhere. I have an assumption that there are dozens or more multisigs that belong to a DAO that have 50-250 ETH sitting in it without a lot of activity. If those things had been run on something like JB, maybe there could have been tools JB would have offered to make sure funds like that were put to use.</p><p>I definitely do agree regarding the interface/tooling offerings— it’ll be interesting to see what happens since JB is one interface right now, and that has value. But ultimately I think we’ll see more interface experimentation. In the past when the Mandarin speakers came in, I was supportive of the idea to create some kind of interface that’s more conducive to that new community group. As JB grows I think we may see things like that.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-do-you-think-pmf-looks-like-for-jb">What do you think PMF looks like for JB?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-do-you-think-pmf-looks-like-for-jb" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I’m most interested in enduring projects that use the protocl as their treasury. I think—and maybe my thinking has evolved on it— but last year as I got to understand JB in greater detail, I felt like there’s two functions for DAOs. One is a place to hold your assets— that’s JB— whether assets are ETH or NFTs or whatever— and the other a place where governance happens. I don’t know that we’ve figured out the most effective way to run governance, but JB governance works extremely well in my opinion. The way JB uses the treasury to handle contributor salary, other expenses, or the network effect when projects pay each other— for instance how JB relates to Wagmi, Canu, Peel, Lexicon Devils— collaborative DAOs end up holding a piece of each other and having a stake in each other’s future. That has potential to have a serious network effect.</p><p>Look at SharkDAO, they have a huge amount of JBX, in their case they don’t really vote on stuff and their JBX isn’t super valuable, but it would be nice to start to see that happen with partner DAOs.</p><p>I think the thing we’re missing is the NFT thing— that’s the key in my opinion to returning revenue over time. Canu, Wagmi, etc., are paid through JB, so they can show how great the network is because they have locked in revenue from the revenue fees JB takes from all projects on the protocol. I think if we could create non-JB originating revenues, that would be fascinating.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="not-to-mention-the-landscape-may-be-changing-a-bit-here-lets-talk-about-soulbound-tokens-sbts-which-may-be-on-the-horizon-the-idea-here-is-tokens-that-are-non-transferable-some-say-good-idea-others-say-its-just-a-way-to-make-resumes-in-web3-what-do-you-make-of-that">Not to mention the landscape may be changing a bit here. Let’s talk about “Soulbound” tokens (SBTs), which may be on the horizon. The idea here is tokens that are non-transferable. Some say good idea, others say it’s just a way to make resumes in web3. What do you make of that?<a class="hash-link" href="#not-to-mention-the-landscape-may-be-changing-a-bit-here-lets-talk-about-soulbound-tokens-sbts-which-may-be-on-the-horizon-the-idea-here-is-tokens-that-are-non-transferable-some-say-good-idea-others-say-its-just-a-way-to-make-resumes-in-web3-what-do-you-make-of-that" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The idea of non-transferable tokens… it’s interesting. I think no matter what in web3, if you’re an amazing code you will probably always get work. But that being said treating SBT’s like a resume can definitely happen too. I have to say I haven’t read the paper yet, so I’m just going off of what I heard floating around the web3 space.</p><p>Long term, there’s a decent argument against it, which is that in ten years I don’t think any of us will be using the same wallet. But overall, I think it’s trying to answer the problem of these membership DAOs. If you base your membership on holding a market-tradable token, the appreciation of the token will ultimately result in the dilution of the quality of the members of your community as people sell.</p><p>Also JokeDAO comes to mind, where if you participate in their competition by submitting a joke, you get voting tokens for the subsequent competition.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="one-time-use-tokens-in-other-words">One-time use tokens in other words.<a class="hash-link" href="#one-time-use-tokens-in-other-words" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Yes exactly. I think that’s even more interesting to be honest. The ecosystem rewards people for trying new things and experimenting.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-about-sbts-as-a-scarlet-letter-in-other-words-as-a-means-to-damage-someone">What about SBT’s as a scarlet letter, in other words as a means to damage someone?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-about-sbts-as-a-scarlet-letter-in-other-words-as-a-means-to-damage-someone" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>For sure that could happen, I think it will depend on the person minting and their reputation. One of the things about NFTs I wondered was people doing antisocial NFTs, like people tokenizing their virginity, or tokenizing school shooters.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="excellent-points-whos-your-favorite-contributor-and-why-is-it-tankbottoms">Excellent points. Who’s your favorite contributor, and why is it tankbottoms?<a class="hash-link" href="#excellent-points-whos-your-favorite-contributor-and-why-is-it-tankbottoms" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Haha. Tankbottoms is great. There are so many great contributors honestly. If I had to point to anyone in particular, the person I admire most or seek to learn the most from is jango. There are many talented contributors, but jango has the talent I most wish I had— which is real clarity. It doesn’t mean jango knows everything and everyone follows him. It means he has real clarity around orientation to questions. You could call it vision, but that maybe that’s reductive. It’s more like in discussions he’s able to refocus very fluently. And of course being able to travel up and down the stack is incredible. Tankbottoms also is an unbelievable contributor in terms of accumulated experience and raw skill, which is so great. I mean, he’s just turning out stuff that other teams talk about for a year, and tank turns it out like that.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-something-people-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you">What is something people would be surprised to learn about you?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-something-people-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Lately I’ve been doing kickboxing every week with my girlfriend and roommate. I’m also a total youtube fanatic and I rarely watch under 2x speed. My biggest interest for the past little while is in Magic the Gathering! A friend gave me the idea that we’re like the CPUs when we play MtG, and the game is the rules of machine, and… it’s like if javascript was run by a company and the only thing you could exercise and execute were functions that are sold 10 times a year. I’m really fascinated by it. I also love going on really long walks, like for hours and hours.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-does-the-future-have-in-store-for-nicholas">What does the future have in store for nicholas?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-does-the-future-have-in-store-for-nicholas" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I’m working on an NFT collection, actually, that I’m really pumped about.

Burtula has posted a new animation of a Banny (Peach Banny to be precise) getting kidnapped in her sleep. Mieos likes it, but suggests smoothing it out, so the kidnapping can seem more natural. Tankbottoms is asking about asset folders to be filled out, and Sage is coming off being stranded in Idaho with a transmission-less car and working feverishly through her phone.</p><p>It’s only 8:30am. The day is just beginning. Felix has spent the better part of two days sourcing custom-made condoms— tri-fold condoms, to be exact, so each Banny can have their own condom packaging, with a pop-out tri-fold to really bring the point home. A banny wrapped in the coital experience, Felixander would tell you, is the most salient testament to the human condition.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1200pm">12:00pm<a class="hash-link" href="#1200pm" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Burtula is taking Mieos’ words of advice to heart. After all, if a banny is going to get kidnapped, that should look natural. What will future customers think if such a traumatic experience seems rushed or premature? Premature— Felix is thinking of a joke, but he’s abstaining. She works tirelessly to craft the Peach banny with more finesse, and in the wait one wonders about banny backgrounds— are we even saving all of them?</p><p>5 creative people stuffed into a studio, and not a shred of organizational prowess between them. Do we have a Peach Banny background? Of course we do. But where is it? Oh yeah, it’s in one of the thirteen discord channels at Wagmi, and it was posted a month ago. It may as well be in the ether, but that doesn’t stop us all from scrolling up wildly to find it.</p><p>Meanwhile tankbottoms is white knuckling it on at least hour 36 of a god-knows-how-long working sprint. His work pace has Cocaine saying bro, slow down, you’re harshing my vibe here. We try to get in touch with him, but on hour 36 the quality of response you can expect is a bit frayed to put it mildly. Tankbottoms operates on a bonding curve of consciousness— if you get your request in early, he will deliver a fucking spectacular answer. But if you’re in that last 5 hour span, you’re gonna get caught holding the bag.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="500pm">5:00pm<a class="hash-link" href="#500pm" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Meanwhile we’re trying to get a presentation on some UI from Sage. The Figma files are fire, and between randomly being jailed and what one can only assume is the wisdom derived from several ayahuasca trips, Sage delivers. She elegantly goes though all the work she’s put into the latest UI iteration, and everyone is blown away and gives her praises, but she has to cut it short because a coyote chewing on some old cigarettes by a roadside is giving her the stink eye, and it may get nasty.</p><p>They ask Felix what he thinks about the UI, but all he can think about is how a single tri-fold condom costs $1.64, but if we get ten thousand that price goes down to $0.46 per unit. He wants to make a joke about units, but he abstains. He’s crafting an email asking how many banana-pictures they can print on a single tri-fold, and he’s doing the math and thinking that we can make condoms cool, one self-referential banana at a time. He’s wondering if we can turn this all into a romance novel, where the Bannies fuck each other in only the most pleasant of language.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="800pm">8:00pm<a class="hash-link" href="#800pm" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We look to Mieos for guidance, but he’s on a treasure hunt deep in cryptovoxels, and he’s trying to embed 12 seed phrases the best he can and he’s having a blast doing it. Meanwhile Burtula is waiting for an answer about her animation, and people may be ready to start considering it, but just at that moment tank is wondering why these blog posts are even generated by lowly meatsacks like Felix— can’t all this shit be generated on chain?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1200am">12:00am<a class="hash-link" href="#1200am" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>For this hour, nothing really happens at all, and nobody is working on anything.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="100am">1:00am<a class="hash-link" href="#100am" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The day is winding down. Condoms have been designed for an order that’s never likely to happen. An animation is still waiting to be fine-tuned. Sage is coming off some hard psychedelics, or at least she should be for the amount of work she does. Tank is crashing for the next 47 hours. Mieos sits back in a recliner with a cat that he caresses knowingly, cackling into the moonlight as he reflects on another solid day.</p><p>Nothing finalized, nothing completed. Incremental progress happened, but the struggle continues the next day. But a hell of a lot of fun was had.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/dao">dao</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/shitpost">shitpost</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/juicebox">juicebox</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/juicebox-in-the-world-of-aeolian">Juicebox in the Words of aeolian</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-05-24T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">May 24, 2022</time> · <!-- -->9 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/realfelixander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1509677708854239233/Bsru0Xks_400x400.jpg" alt="Felixander"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/realfelixander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Felixander</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Community Member</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>“Juicebox in the words of” is a series that highlights JB community members in interview form.

Generally when I want to dive into something, I really wanna get into the nuts/bolts and learn it from the ground up. I finally found myself with the time to do that, and me and a couple friends found this NFT project we liked, and even though we couldn’t really afford to buy the NFT separately, if we pull our funds together… and it was like a lightbulb moment. We thought hey, what about this whole DAO thing happening— what if we make a DAO that buys some NFTs. So I found JB and started poking around, and it was coincidentally the same time that ConstitutionDAO was happening. I was drawn in by the amazing branding of Banny (a banana smoking a joint was just amazing) and the next day I wake up, log into discord, and I see the treasury has grown to like 20 million overnight. Once I saw that and started really thinking about the potential of this thing I immediately dropped everything I was doing and started trying to contribute where I could, especially on the dev side and front-end side. Peri welcomed us with open arms and the rest is history as they say.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="awesome-so-much-talk-lately-about-v2-how-would-you-put-v2-in-perspective-for-someone-not-technically-aware-of-all-the-changes">Awesome. So much talk lately about V2! How would you put V2 in perspective for someone not technically aware of all the changes?<a class="hash-link" href="#awesome-so-much-talk-lately-about-v2-how-would-you-put-v2-in-perspective-for-someone-not-technically-aware-of-all-the-changes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>V2, hmm. When we talk about V2 we’re talking about the protocol itself. Jango, Drgorilla and a bunch of others have identified some tings about V1 which were restrictive, like that projects can only raise money in ETH and not in other currencies, that there’s less flexibility around how they can configure projects to meet their needs, and so on. The protocol guys said let’s start developing V2 and improve it from the ground up, and so the front-end’s job in that is basically to support those new additions. There’s exciting potential use cases, like funding your project through your own NFT launch, or like a project that comes along that says we want to award contributors with an NFT that they can sell on secondary market, and the proceeds of those NFTs will go straight into a JB treasury. Another biggie is supporting multi-currencies— projects accepting stablecoins instead of just ETH. Truthfully we don’t even know all the possibilities that it is hopefully going to open up, which is what makes it all the more exciting.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="im-reminded-of-the-story-of-that-city-planner-in-england-way-back-when-who-had-the-roads-built-twice-as-wide-as-necessary-people-thought-he-was-crazy-but-he-saw-a-future-with-population-explosion-do-you-view-v2-as-built-for-the-realities-of-tomorrow">I’m reminded of the story of that city planner in England way back when, who had the roads built twice as wide as necessary.

When you’re building a protocol as the ecosystem saw with V1, it enables a set of use cases which, in the case of V1, proved to be successful with big fundraisers that make big volume in a short amount of time. Look at the internet– such a non-restrictive, base-level protocol, and look at it now. The creators of the internet would have had no idea that it would become what it is now. Not unlike JB with this website of this smoking banana that enables millions of dollars of fundraising.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="theres-been-this-wonderful-discussion-about-compensation-lately-where-does-a-dao-strike-a-balance-between-compensating-members-and-staying-lean-for-a-down-the-line-bigger-payout">There’s been this wonderful discussion about compensation lately.

Like someone said in that thread on compensation— I don’t remember who— but comparing people based on a number is just not healthy, right? That’s what people don’t like about traditional corporate life, and that’s why people find themselves in web3 and crypto. They want to escape that world and operate in a space that lets them do what interests them the most. In terms of how to think about it from a first-principles perspective, which I’m trying to do, let’s start with startups. I don’t think the startup model is perfect by any means– it probably disproportionately rewards the founders more than early builders. So that’s not exactly a blueprint for us either.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="its-just-so-complicated-right-so-many-smart-people-and-no-one-has-been-able-to-find-that-holy-grail-answer">It’s just so complicated right?

And drawing from the corporate world and those structures probably is not the right way to go about it either. I’m not a crypto/web3 maximalist in that sense though, I do think people can learn things from those who have come before us, but we’re here to make our own rules and to do what makes sense for us and what leads to the most amazing ecosystem that we can possibly build. That’s what we’re all here to do. The fact that that thread exists and other threads like it exist is a real testament to this community because we’re driven and passionate about figuring this stuff out. That, in my opinion, is the sign of a really healthy community.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="no-egos-can-be-around-in-this-right-how-come-egos-dont-seem-to-clash-more-in-these-situations">No egos can be around in this right– how come egos don’t seem to clash more in these situations?<a class="hash-link" href="#no-egos-can-be-around-in-this-right-how-come-egos-dont-seem-to-clash-more-in-these-situations" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>There’s something about JB, or the way that the community presents itself, whether on socials or within the discord, that it leads to a certain type of person sticking around. People are sufficiently motivated at JB. When teams break apart and things don’t happen it’s because people gave up on figuring out how to make it work. Everyone here recognizes the opportunity we have in front of us, to build this amazing thing and a solid foundation for us to all go forward. It’s a recognition that if we can really sit down and work all this stuff out we’re really gonna be able to build amazing things.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="do-you-think-the-jb-runway-threatened-by-the-compensation-models-we-have-now-jb-never-had-any-vc-coming-in-so-how-do-you-reconcile-that">Do you think the JB runway threatened by the compensation models we have now?

We really do have to think about this stuff. We have to sit down and think about it from a first-principles perspective, rather than approaching it in the traditional way of doing these things.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-about-the-workflow-over-time-problem-ie-what-happens-when-your-job-drops-off-in-work-to-do-because-you-executed-the-task-but-youre-still-getting-this-big-recurring-payout">What about the workflow over time problem– ie, what happens when your job drops off in work to do because you executed the task, but you’re still getting this big recurring payout?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-about-the-workflow-over-time-problem-ie-what-happens-when-your-job-drops-off-in-work-to-do-because-you-executed-the-task-but-youre-still-getting-this-big-recurring-payout" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>That’s the biggie, you’ve hit the nail on the head. One model we’ve stewarded is that the front-end team has broken out into its own treasury in Peel, and that allows us to be more intentional with how we fund projects. It really allows two things: we can onboard quickly those who we think are really good, and we can also understand their skill set right away. We know what we’re looking for and the broader DAO doesn’t have to go in and make a decision on every single recurring payout proposal that comes through that affects the front-end. That’s one model that’s been working for us, but these things are all emerging, and that what makes me super excited to be here in JB and in web3.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="got-it-okay-lets-get-down-to-brass-tacks-whos-your-favorite-jb-member-and-why-is-it-jango">Got it.

I’m just gonna quote it here:</p><p><em>“i like hangin with folks that can be fluid between bullshitting and manifesting, fluid between appreciating beauty and ugly, fluid between conversation and silence, fluid between humor and practicality, fluid between been in awe of everything and focusing on the next idea in front of us. I&#x27;m attracted as fuck to people with big imaginations who make moves towards them.”</em></p><p>That was like such an amazing statement because it’s really hard to find people who are <em>your</em> people. I feel like my people are this: people who strike that balance between brilliance and focus, but also are able to laugh at the ridiculousness of life, and so I guess when I read that I was like damn, I will definitely be vibing here for many years.</p><p>But my homies at Peel definitely need a huge shoutout. This is the dream team and I&#x27;m super lucky to be a part of it.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-something-that-people-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you">What’s something that people would be surprised to learn about you?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-something-that-people-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Hmm… I don’t really know. I guess one thing is that I started programming very late, and I actually always wanted to be a film composer— writing music for movies. That’s what I was doing before becoming a software engineer. Through high school I was pretty much all about music; I played piano and a bunch of other instruments and I got really into writing music for film, and I thought I would take that road. Eventually I kind of just realized it wasn’t coming from a place of pure passion and excitement. I realized as a musician you have to write music you don’t care to write oftentimes, and take jobs that don’t interest you at all. So I looked for another avenue and it was kind of just random how it happened: I went to university for some unrelated degree and fell in love with programming and comp sci along the way.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/dao">dao</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/interview">interview</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/juicebox">juicebox</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/how-juicebox-for-nfts">HOW Juicebox for NFT Projects?</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-05-24T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">May 24, 2022</time> · <!-- -->5 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/JohnnyD_eth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1509621120181444608/lycnkGHp_400x400.jpg" alt="johnnyD"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/JohnnyD_eth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">johnnyD</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Peel Contributor</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>In case you don’t know, Juicebox is the best way to fund and operate any Web3 business, especially NFT projects.

Funding<a class="hash-link" href="#1-funding" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="funding-cycles">Funding cycles<a class="hash-link" href="#funding-cycles" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>We highly recommend using a funding cycle. This is the time period over which distributions will be made and other Juicebox settings such as the discount rate will be applied. Common funding cycle lengths are 1 week, 2 weeks or 1 month.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="distributions">Distributions<a class="hash-link" href="#distributions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>You can specify the amount you’d like to distribute to each member of your team per funding cycle from the treasury. If you don’t raise the total amount of funds you’ve planned for your whole team, then each team member will be paid the percentage you’ve specified for them from any funds you have raised. For instance, if you planned for Mike and Bob to get 1 ETH each per week, but you only raised 1 ETH total in a certain week, then they will just get 0.5 ETH each. </p><p>If you’re opting not to go for the shared treasury approach, you can route all funds from the treasury straight to the owner, or a percentage cut to any other wallet address.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="token">Token<a class="hash-link" href="#token" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reserved-rate">Reserved rate<a class="hash-link" href="#reserved-rate" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>As mentioned earlier, whenever new tokens are minted as a result of someone buying an NFT or contributing for tokens straight up, this percentage of those new tokens will be reserved and the rest will go to the buyer. By default, these tokens are reserved for the project owner, but you can also allocate portions to other wallet addresses. A reserved rate of 50% will ensure the project owners maintain a majority share of the treasury and may be a good option for your project. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="discount-rate">Discount rate<a class="hash-link" href="#discount-rate" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>The discount rate incentivises people to get in early on your project. It controls how the issue rate of your community ERC20 token changes over time. A higher discount rate means people who buy your NFT in the early days will receive more tokens / ETH than those who come in later. An exact figure is hard to give, but with a funding cycle length of 2 weeks, a discount rate of 10% may be a good place to start.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="redemption-rate">Redemption rate<a class="hash-link" href="#redemption-rate" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>This redemption rate encourages token holders to hodl and stick with your project token for the long term. On a lower redemption rate, redeeming a token increases the value of each remaining token, creating an incentive to hold tokens longer than other holders. Similar to the discount rate, you’ll have to gauge how aggressively you want to pull this level, but a redemption rate between 50 and 75% is probably a good place to start. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-rules">3. Rules<a class="hash-link" href="#3-rules" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="pause-payments">Pause payments<a class="hash-link" href="#pause-payments" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>You probably don’t want to check this. Check it only if you want to hold off payments for a certain period after you create your project.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="allow-token-minting">Allow token minting<a class="hash-link" href="#allow-token-minting" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>You probably don’t want to check this either, it allows project owners to mint any amount of tokens to anyone on demand. Whenever you have this enabled, your project will have a warning flag on its Juicebox page warning contributors of the possibility of their tokens being diluted. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reconfiguration">Reconfiguration<a class="hash-link" href="#reconfiguration" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>This is important. It restricts how long before the next funding cycle reconfigurations must be submitted before they are able to take effect. For example, with a 3-day delay (a good starting point), a reconfiguration to an upcoming funding cycle must be submitted at least 3 days before it starts. It’s a great way to ensure your community against any malicious owner behavior. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-create-a-payable-address">2. Create a payable address<a class="hash-link" href="#2-create-a-payable-address" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>This will create an Ethereum address that can be used to pay your project, rather than having to go through the Juicebox interface. It will be necessary in the model of the Juicebox NFT project we’re going for, since you will use this address as the destination for your royalty fees. You will be prompted to do this when you create your project, but can do it later at any time in the ‘Tools’ section of your project page pictured below. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image2-5d26b330ea8f22c7d9c6ab98e456de54.png" width="1999" height="616" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-do-your-thang-on-opensea-or-wherever-send-royalty-fees-to-the-payable-address-let-the-magic-happen">3.

It has been responsible for some of the biggest names in crypto community fundraising, including ConstitutionDAO, AssangeDAO and MoonDAO. Funding and operating an NFT project with Juicebox is an especially effective way to leverage the protocol, providing massive benefits to both owners and their communities. In this article we’ll cover why, and <a href="/blog/how-juicebox-for-nfts">in a follow-up article, we’ll cover how</a>.</p><p>In this article: </p><ol><li>Basics of the Juicebox protocol.</li><li>Why Juicebox NFT projects are better.</li><li>What does it cost?</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-basics-of-juicebox">1. Basics of Juicebox<a class="hash-link" href="#1-basics-of-juicebox" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Juicebox allows people and communities to crowdfund their project and give their contributors a stake as community tokens (ERC20) in return. Once funds have been raised, the protocol can be leveraged to automate payments from the treasury in a controlled, transparent and decentralized fashion. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-why-juicebox-nft-projects-are-better">2. Why Juicebox NFT projects are better<a class="hash-link" href="#2-why-juicebox-nft-projects-are-better" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Juicebox NFT projects are a win-win for both communities and owners. There are countless ways you can configure your Juicebox project for your specific goals, but here’s a general strategy we recommend for NFT projects: </p><p>Instead of sending your NFT royalty fees directly to the owner’s wallet, you can send them to a shared treasury owned by your community. Upon buying an NFT (and paying the royalty fee), the new owners of your NFT’s would automatically receive an amount of your community tokens proportional to their purchase amount. The more someone pays for an NFT, the more tokens they receive. This gives your community members a formal and quantifiable stake in the shared treasury - your project as a whole. Your community could also contribute and gain stake in your project by just buying tokens, not necessarily having to own an NFT. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="for-communities">For communities<a class="hash-link" href="#for-communities" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="token-value">Token value<a class="hash-link" href="#token-value" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>You can use these tokens for anything you want, perhaps governance, raffles or exclusive access to future drops. But a unique feature of Juicebox is that it allows the option for these tokens to be redeemed by community members for a portion of your project’s treasury. As the pie grows over time, a contributor’s tokens will be worth more. Your community can gain on top of just the increase in value of their NFT’s.</p><p>Having a shared treasury is optional, however, and you could instead just have all royalty fees sent to the Juicebox project route straight to the creators. In this case, the token your community receives could not be redeemed for any ETH. </p><p><strong>Your community can gain on top of just the increase in value of their NFT’s.</strong></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="trust-and-transparency">Trust and transparency<a class="hash-link" href="#trust-and-transparency" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Firstly, a properly configured Juicebox project makes rug-pulls impossible. You can give your community time to react before any changes to your funding and spending parameters take effect. </p><p>Additionally, your Juicebox page shows exactly how all your funds are flowing - how much and where it’s coming from, and where those funds are subsequently being spent. The only way funds can leave the treasury is by configuring and scheduling a payment, for which your community will always have time to react to. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image1-26d67a61b9ceb1555aa19b1714143f81.png" width="1999" height="1013" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><em>Spending (left) and income (right) shown on a project’s Juicebox page</em></p><p>You may be asking, <em>“Ok I see the benefit for my community, but what’s in it for the owner?&quot;</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="for-owners">For owners<a class="hash-link" href="#for-owners" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="maintain-a-high-stake-in-your-project-using-the-reserved-rate">Maintain a high stake in your project using the Reserved Rate.<a class="hash-link" href="#maintain-a-high-stake-in-your-project-using-the-reserved-rate" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>If you choose the option of your token holders being able to redeem from a shared treasury, we should mention that as an owner you can control exactly how much stake you maintain of this treasury over time. The reserved rate allows you to keep a portion of all newly minted tokens. A 50% reserved rate means you will maintain a 50% ownership of treasury no matter how big your project gets. </p><p>This is mostly irrelevant if you don’t want a shared treasury and to simply route all funds into the project straight to creators. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="allow-for-people-to-contribute-to-your-project-without-buying-an-nft-and-therefore-raise-more-funds">Allow for people to contribute to your project without buying an NFT and, therefore, raise more funds.<a class="hash-link" href="#allow-for-people-to-contribute-to-your-project-without-buying-an-nft-and-therefore-raise-more-funds" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>This model opens up a massive and mostly untapped market of people interested in investing in an NFT project without necessarily buying an NFT. Whether it be too high of a floor price, not wanting to go through the whole selection/auction/listing process, or anything else, Juicebox opens the door of your project to these people through community tokens.</p><p>Consider if the projects like the Bored Apes had followed this model - how much more funds could the creators have raised as a result of people buying some stake worth less than the purchase price of a Bored Ape? </p><p>How much more funds could the <!-- -->[Bored Apes]<!-- --> creators have raised as a result of people buying some stake worth less than the purchase price of a Bored Ape? </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="automate-payments-to-key-members-of-your-team">Automate payments to key members of your team.<a class="hash-link" href="#automate-payments-to-key-members-of-your-team" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>If you’re going for the shared treasury approach, Juicebox allows you to pre-program specific distribution amounts from your treasury to any ETH address, e.g. pay vitalik.eth US$1000 every week. This saves the hassle of manually transferring funds to your team from your personal or shared multisig wallet. </p><p>Otherwise, as mentioned prior, you can simply route all funds from the project to creators and their teams. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-what-does-it-cost">3. What does it cost?<a class="hash-link" href="#3-what-does-it-cost" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Up front, all Juicebox costs is gas. As of the 23th of May, it’s about US$150-200 worth of gas to launch your project, deploy your own ERC20 token and a payable ETH address for you to link your royalty fees to. Then, for any funds you end up withdrawing from your project’s treasury, you’ll pay a 2.5% fee to Juicebox. But, for this 2.5% cut of your payout distributions, you’ll receive Juicebox’s native token (JBX) in return at its current issue rate. Moreover, your fee will give you a growing stake of Juicebox’s expanding ecosystem and treasury. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>If this has already been enough information for one reading, feel free to tap out now.

As the DAOs onboarder and bona fide swag and sticker monger, you can see him around the discord always helpful and ready to answer questions. Recently we had a moment to chat and I was able to hear his wonderful JB origin story, and his priorities in the JB space. Check it out below!</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-jb-changed-since-youve-been-here">How’d you get started with JB and how has JB changed since you’ve been here?<a class="hash-link" href="#howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-jb-changed-since-youve-been-here" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I was in there early! I learned about DAOs through Rare Pizzas and this guy named snax— who I gotta give a shoutout to ‘cause he’s the one who introduced me to DAOs— was buying free pizzas on pizza day. It was me and him and 2 other peeps on Clubhouse, and I was like this is stupid, no way this is gonna happen. As I got more comfortable in the DAO space, I eventually found my way to SharkDAO. I had started seeing these SharkDAO logos and I figured hey, I have a printing shop, I should make some hoodies with logos on them to give away, and I did (and they were expensive!). Jango and nicholas were people who helped guide me through sending out those hoodies, and so I got to know them and got to know JB. I decided to start making some JB clothing with graphics as well, and eventually I got put together with Zeugh and the talk was about community. I started helping wherever help was needed, like with governance, moving proposals along as they were coming in, etc. Eventually filipv jumped in and we started tag-teaming it and doing the podcast, which ran for a while.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="filipv-is-great-is-it-fair-to-call-you-two-the-gruesome-twosome">Filipv is great. Is it fair to call you two the gruesome twosome?<a class="hash-link" href="#filipv-is-great-is-it-fair-to-call-you-two-the-gruesome-twosome" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We worked very closely together and he ended up taking on some huge responsibilities, but we still lean on each other a lot when it comes to opinions and direction. I would definitely say I’ve learned a ton from him and I think he would say the same. Every once in a while we’ll pick up the phone and call each other and just say “Hey, how you doin’?”.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-see-you-as-this-onboarding-wizard-where-did-that-start">I see you as this onboarding wizard, where did that start?<a class="hash-link" href="#i-see-you-as-this-onboarding-wizard-where-did-that-start" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>It’s definitely a roll I’ve grown comfortable doing. I remember doing onboarding with MoonDAO and Slice, and eventually then for JB. It’s also interesting that that sort of merged into this weird testing and feedback roll too. I found myself in the front-end chat more and more (I don’t know if I’m providing value there– I hope I am!) to try to test various things, launch projects on test net, find obscure bugs that are here and there and provide suggestions/feedback based on what the onboarding calls are giving me, so it’s kind of become a merged roll. Being in that close proximity to the user gives a lot of great insight and perspective.</p><p>I also think there needs to be a shield between the regular user and developers. I’m very adamant that there needs to be some distance there. I’ve always appreciated jango saying we’re all builders at JB, but let’s be honest, they’re (the devs) are the builders– the developers on the JB protocol side and the Peel Team, they’re really building and everyone else is providing support. Since I joined JB I’ve always felt the need to kind of protect the jangos of JB because they’re so hyper focused that distractions can lead to mistakes, and that can be a big problem. I think a lot of organizations should take on that approach, to be honest, to make sure those core builders are shielded from the basic questions that other contributors can answer. I feel like that’s where I slid right in, I can answer those questions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="im-reminded-of-high-level-athletes-and-how-theyre-trained-the-trainer-almost-has-to-take-a-caretaker-role-ensuring-that-distractionsobstacles-are-cleared-so-that-the-athlete-can-do-what-they-do-perform">I’m reminded of high level athletes and how they’re trained. The trainer almost has to take a caretaker role, ensuring that distractions/obstacles are cleared so that the athlete can do what they do: perform.<a class="hash-link" href="#im-reminded-of-high-level-athletes-and-how-theyre-trained-the-trainer-almost-has-to-take-a-caretaker-role-ensuring-that-distractionsobstacles-are-cleared-so-that-the-athlete-can-do-what-they-do-perform" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Exactly. It’s all about minimizing distraction. It’s interesting that you bring up athletics; I was a former athlete and after that have been involved in high level training— olympics, NCAA athletes— and the one thing I’ve carried on in my life moving into JB and other things is to eliminate distractions and be in the moment. If you are distracted about the outcome of something, you’re taking away energy from the task that you’re actually doing, and in athletics that could be the difference between a win and a loss, a championship and coming in second. It sounds super corny but launching new extensions has become that for me– that’s the championship, we gotta get there, how do we get there, how do we stay focused are the questions I have bouncing around in my head. I’ve always been an idea person— someone who can really thrive in environments where we’re talking about ideas— and I’ve always been good at that I felt, and JB is this crazy environment where people take ideas and build off of it into something else. It’s like a dream come true.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="there-almost-seems-to-be-a-hippy-spirit-at-jb-people-are-just-so-open-im-thinking-of-the-compensation-discussion-from-a-few-weeks-ago-just-an-open-discussion-no-one-at-each-others-throats">There almost seems to be a hippy spirit at JB– people are just so open. I’m thinking of the compensation discussion from a few weeks ago. Just an open discussion, no one at each other’s throats.<a class="hash-link" href="#there-almost-seems-to-be-a-hippy-spirit-at-jb-people-are-just-so-open-im-thinking-of-the-compensation-discussion-from-a-few-weeks-ago-just-an-open-discussion-no-one-at-each-others-throats" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Yeah, especially with a topic that’s been so sensitive our whole lives– we don’t talk about salary IRL, and to have this open dialogue is special. More so to have the validation that what you’re providing is worth the payout that you’re receiving– there’s no better feeling than that. Having the support of the community has been an amazing feeling for me. People don’t realize how important that is to me– to my personal being. It’s quite an experience and one that I don’t take for granted.</p><p>Regarding compensation, if you don’t pay the people who are irreplaceable, they’re gonna go somewhere else. I think that’s an important point. There’s also people within the DAO that are just completely connected to the DAO itself, like if jango leaves, or Drgorilla leaves, what is JB, or Peel, or what even happens to JB?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fair-question">Fair question.<a class="hash-link" href="#fair-question" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I’ll tell ya right now– if jango decides to do another project, I would ask him if I can go with him. You just can’t replace certain people. So if you don’t pay them, they’re gonna be gone. All that said, I do think we need to be aware that we don’t have unlimited resourced. At the same time I think there’s enough people in the DAO that aren’t necessarily leaning on JB for all their bills/everything they do. So if there’s an emergency situation where people have to back off/reduce payout, I think we’ll see that happen.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-the-lack-of-assholes-and-mentally-checked-out-people-at-juicebox">Why the lack of assholes and mentally checked-out people at Juicebox?<a class="hash-link" href="#why-the-lack-of-assholes-and-mentally-checked-out-people-at-juicebox" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I think because everyone at JB right now has proven their value, and people who haven’t don’t stay around for very long; they weed themselves out. I think there’s also a level of respect from each person that everybody kind of has each other’s back. If you come in and try to take advantage of the DAO, I think the community can read that like a book because we all had to pay our dues. Everyone who’s being paid recurring payouts has been told no at least once– that’s a common denominator we all have. I think when everyone’s gone through that there’s a level of respect and community, which you see in how we treat each other in our day-to-day.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="for-sure-okay-switching-gears-who-is-your-favorite-contributor-and-why-is-it-zeugh">For sure! Okay switching gears: who is your favorite contributor, and why is it Zeugh?<a class="hash-link" href="#for-sure-okay-switching-gears-who-is-your-favorite-contributor-and-why-is-it-zeugh" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Haha, I think Zeugh is great– he’s awesome!</p><p>You know, I don’t know who my favorite contributor is. I’ve worked closest with jango and filipv probably, but I’ve gotten to know the peel team a bit more and I’ve really enjoyed them asking me for feedback/allowing me to provide feedback. Right now I couldn’t answer who, I just love working with jango and filip– they definitely help me out and give me a strong feeling of purpose.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-something-somebody-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you">What’s something somebody would be surprised to learn about you?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-something-somebody-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I think the biggest surprise would be… I have four kids! That is something that actually helps me with what I’m doing at JB– I’m good with time management/organization, and can make time for everything. My oldest son is really active with sports, so I’m juggling a lot, but even on the sidelines I’m always on the discord.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/dao">dao</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/interview">interview</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/juicebox">juicebox</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/juicebox-in-the-words-of-zeugh">Juicebox in the Words of Zeugh</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-05-14T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">May 14, 2022</time> · <!-- -->12 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/realfelixander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1509677708854239233/Bsru0Xks_400x400.jpg" alt="Felixander"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/realfelixander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Felixander</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Community Member</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>“Juicebox in the words of” is a series that highlights JB community members in interview form.

DAOs amazed me and i had my eyes on crypto for a while… but when I found out DAOs existed I was very excited to work with them. I joined a discord server and got involved with Tiles DAO, and eventually just explored more. I wasn’t in JB way at the beginning, but I did join in the first week after release. When the question came up that a community manager was needed, I put my name out there. I had never been a comm manager per se, but had been doing comm management for other products I was helping release and so I figured I’d take it on, got voted in, and hit the ground running. I started</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-youre-an-og">So you’re an OG.<a class="hash-link" href="#so-youre-an-og" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I joined in week 1 of JB, back at FC1. Although regarding crypto as a whole, I’m pretty much a newbie. JB was the first project I really got involved in and put my hands on.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wow-thats-nuts-youve-seen-the-evolution-of-jb-from-start-to-right-now-would-you-say-its-unrecognizable">Wow, that’s nuts— you’ve seen the evolution of JB from start to right now. Would you say it’s unrecognizable?<a class="hash-link" href="#wow-thats-nuts-youve-seen-the-evolution-of-jb-from-start-to-right-now-would-you-say-its-unrecognizable" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>From the beginning? I wouldn’t say unrecognizable because I think some of the core values of transparency, building out in the open, and great vibes have been around since day one. The core values have not changed, and that’s beautiful.</p><p>I think of it like a sapling and tree, just as they are different, they are also the same.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-would-you-describe-your-role-at-jb">How would you describe your role at JB?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-would-you-describe-your-role-at-jb" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A confusing one, firstly, but also a very interesting one. Rarely are two days the same. There is a lot of time spent online in chats and severs, whether the Chinese chats to try to understand community issues, or in other servers to learn new tools they’re using, practices they have, and how they engage/reward/manage a sustainable growth.</p><p>Lately we’ve pushed hard on trying to automate governance with guys like filipv, Phytann, jigglyjamz, lazervike and others, and Canu has been heavily involved in this as well.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-has-it-been-like-working-with-the-chinese-community-and-their-role-at-jb">What has it been like working with the Chinese community, and their role at JB?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-has-it-been-like-working-with-the-chinese-community-and-their-role-at-jb" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>It’s one of the better things that happened to JB ever, but at the same time definitely one of the biggest challenges. Bringing our Chinese members together in a governance process where we all get the power to decide what we do is a complex thing, but it’s exactly what makes us so critical and diverse in what we build. We have to do good stuff– not sensibly good to my taste or American or European tastes, or to Chinese tastes, but it has to be good stuff across the board. That’s very challenging to pull off, but at the same time we’re all a part of the community.</p><p>When the community first came, I remember I would jump in there with google translate to try to make sense of the chats going on in discord. Man, it was so suddenly so many new members, and we had to try to reach out and make those connections. It was an exiting and also exhausting time, especially since google translate can only do so much. I do have to say one of the members who has been a killer and God in moderating the Chinese community, getting them informed and engaged, is twodam. That guy is a beast and I appreciate him so much.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-idea-of-you-sitting-in-discord-with-google-translate-and-trying-to-understand-chinese-is-absolutely-hilarious-to-me">The idea of you sitting in Discord with google translate and trying to understand Chinese is absolutely hilarious to me.<a class="hash-link" href="#the-idea-of-you-sitting-in-discord-with-google-translate-and-trying-to-understand-chinese-is-absolutely-hilarious-to-me" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Let me tell you— now we have the translate bot. It automatically translates. But that day when we got that huge influx of members, it was 3am and my phone starting beeping, beeping, beeping, and I was like ok, silent mode, I’m not working tonight, this is my one night off.</p><p>But it didn’t stop! So I got back to my comp and there were more than 1k new members, all of them Mandarin speakers, and all were over every channel– and up to that day we didn’t have a single Mandarin channel, so I spent the whole night with google translate writing FAQs, basic guides on how to solve the most common questions, translated hundreds of Q’s and ranked them with what were the most relevant answers, and I think it was nicholas and someone else who was in the twitter spaces that joined and were able to pitch in and help. Shout out to those guys and everyone who helped early on with that, it was such a huge task and everyone stepped up. Eventually we even found some university students from the US that we knew who were Chinese and we asked them to translate asap, and that helped a lot too. Now we have really amazing translator teams, the of course the amazing twodam who kills it every day, and so we’ve found a good stride.</p><p>Twodam is amazing, I can’t say enough good things. He ended up in this position of managing the greatest share of governance (by population) and is doing it incredibly well. I’m about convinced that twdam is a team– not a guy, a whole team– because the guy does contracts, community, translates, I mean he’s absolutely incredible.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="where-are-all-the-assholes-at-jb">Where are all the assholes at JB?<a class="hash-link" href="#where-are-all-the-assholes-at-jb" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>That’s a very good question, actually. The main thing on that that fascinates me is that I’ve spent countless hours crunching analytics data on our conversations, running our bots, and so far I haven’t found them either. Idk why, but they are just not around I guess. The funny thing is we’re in the crypto space— people being obnoxious is like breakfast, but somehow at JB we don’t attract these kinds of people.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-something-somebody-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you">What’s something somebody would be surprised to learn about you?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-something-somebody-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I was a comp sci undergrad for 3 years, that’s when I first heard about crypto, and even so it took me 5 years to ever engage in my first transaction (which was in bitcoin!) to actually get into crypto because I was completely against burning the amazon. I was a very critical person of crypto for a good while. I was misinformed.</p><p>I get addicted to hobbies; 2 years ago I was living in a small house in the middle of the woods. I spent about one year living there, talking to my cats or the monkeys who would come to try to steal my food. I was developing digital products and tending to the gardens since I love gardening. I loved the nature, the no-plastic environment, just me and plants, no eating meat. That passed now, I’m back to the animal eating part of life and living around big buildings and concrete and using plastic bags, but that was definitely a life-changing part of my last few years.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-what-changed-the-amazon-can-just-burn-to-the-ground">So what changed? The amazon can just burn to the ground?<a class="hash-link" href="#so-what-changed-the-amazon-can-just-burn-to-the-ground" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I stopped listening to the news and started reading some articles.  After you read the numbers/data you understand that that’s not what’s happening. I was living in the middle of nature trying to find out how possible it was for someone living in society to have the smallest impact in nature– that was the goal of going there– to see how simple/non-violent towards nature I could live without leaving behind civilization and a modern world. I started reading everything I could in every area, so I learned a huge amount and cleared up a lot of misconceptions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fascinating-whos-your-fav-contributor-and-why-is-it-zom_bae">Fascinating. Who’s your fav contributor, and why is it Zom_Bae?<a class="hash-link" href="#fascinating-whos-your-fav-contributor-and-why-is-it-zom_bae" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Haha. I think this gets me into a tight spot here. Although Zom_Bae is terrific, I don’t think I can give her the prize without sharing it with filipv and twodam. I will not even include jango in this one just because that is obvious.</p><p>I can’t choose man, I have the blessing of a very amazing team to work with. If I had to pick, I would share my favorite contributor in four people– Filip, Jango, Twodam, and Zom_Bae. If I had to pick one, I’d go with Zom_Bae. She’s amazing. And the red rocket banny pfp! Zom_Bae does wonders in lots of micro areas around JB community - I would not trust anyone more than her nowadays to be the one who receives and onboards both partners and community members, contributor-wannabes, and everyone in between who needs guidance to navigate our complex environment.</p><p>jango has always been a steward for good culture, has always been bringing some perspectives of open criticism/honest debate since the beginning.</p><p>Filip is a monster– a complete gigabrain going from governance to some automation here and there and finding good minds to help every single area he touches– there’s not an issue I don’t se him going around. Twodam I’ve talked about more than anyone in this inteveriew– it’s well deserved. Bridging two different communities while also building data queries to better observe community trends, and making it look effortless, it’s just amazing…</p><p>But then there’s Mieos and Sage with WAGMI studios and all the vibes– Sage is definitely underrated! A huge shout-out to her and the vibes that we get from Banny and that we get from all the juicy fruits that she brings to life with her art. Banny’s something else.</p><p>Nicholas, filipv, unicorn and 0xSTVG are fucking rocking it, doing amazing at governance issues, really taking the helm on things.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="and-how-about-that-awesome-guy-who-writes-the-banny-histories-huh">And how about that awesome guy who writes the Banny histories, huh?<a class="hash-link" href="#and-how-about-that-awesome-guy-who-writes-the-banny-histories-huh" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>But he’s just in the house, I mean he’s around here and there...

I am the apex of ADHD in a human being. That’s why I tend to work in the night because everyone else is sleeping and that’s less things to get distracted with. I’m kind of a workaholic; I engage a good part of my hobbies like they’re work. I played (semi-professionaly) League of Legends for a while. Very low-tier stuff though.</p><p>I love gardening. I used to have an ant farm; I would catch ant queens in mating season and I started my own ant farm. I raised some ants.</p><p>My hobby is changing hobbies– I have 3-month sprints where I have hyper-focus in something, study a lot and research a lot, get super nerdy, and then I move on to the next thing. I’ve been through organic chemistry– making my own hygiene products. Star wars– reading all I could in the expanded universe. Wicca magic. Cocktails. Making events (very close to community management)! And more to come = )</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thats-awesome-whats-the-favorite-thing-youre-looking-forward-to">That’s awesome. What’s the favorite thing you’re looking forward to?<a class="hash-link" href="#thats-awesome-whats-the-favorite-thing-youre-looking-forward-to" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I’ll have to split the answer in two. The first - watching how crypto changes the world. I’m gonna play a part and I want to play the best part I can. I used to say in my twitter, “I am here to make sure the next big social network is not owned by a corporation, but is co-owned”. I want to see the power of open data, public ledgers, collective ownership over the digital assets that currently rule over people’s days most of the time, and so much more. I want to watch as that unfolds and try to play a part, and I think it will happen in a massive way.</p><p>As for myself, I’m really really keen to creating those bridges between people building stuff and people that need stuff built. I’ll be going nomad for a while and traveling to try to find a way to get a local communities to organize and find solutions through the tech they’re creating. Local communities are powerful and we’re finally at a point where digital communities are also hitting that kind of strength. If we can merge local and digital communities we can really change things. When the people making products, the politicians making promises, etc., are also the people who are living in a community, they can’t just say they’ll do things and not do them. Suddenly there is accountability, and things get better. I want to build a solar-punk future. It sounds crazy, but I used to say, “I’m not crazy, I’m just hopeful.”</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/dao">dao</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/interview">interview</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/juicebox">juicebox</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/juicebox-in-the-words-of-drgorilla">Juicebox in the Words of DrGorilla</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-05-06T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">May 6, 2022</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/realfelixander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1509677708854239233/Bsru0Xks_400x400.jpg" alt="Felixander"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/realfelixander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Felixander</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Community Member</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>“Juicebox in the words of” is a series that highlights JB community members in interview form.

I had left previous projects because they were either running in circle or became cash-grabs, so I was looking for something more interesting (for a solidity dev) to do. I joined the Discord the same day nicholas reached out and wrote my first batch of unit tests the same night!</p><p>This period was in-between ConstitutionDAO and AssangeDAO, so we were in some kind of a wave of newcomers to JuiceboxDAO. Since then, Juicebox and JuiceboxDAO have been maturing a lot, in terms of governance, tech, identity (and there are so many cool things yet to come) :)</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thats-such-an-awesome-origin-story-one-thing-that-has-struck-me-is-how-open-and-inclusive-people-are-at-jb-i-havent-encountered-a-single-asshole-yet-where-are-they">That&#x27;s such an awesome origin story.
