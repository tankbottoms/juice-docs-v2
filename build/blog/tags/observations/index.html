So enjoy this short article on 18th century critical theory and the folly of technological prophesies.</p><p>Historicism, that nebulous academic term that finds itself increasingly harder to define the more you delve into it, is at play more than you may think in the ever-changing landscape of web3. A term originally coined by Friedrich Schlegel a couple centuries ago, we will define it– for the purposes of this article– simply as the idea that societies at different times in history can oftentimes lose sight of the fact that time keeps marching forward. The future, it turns out, isn’t the easiest thing to predict. And the present doesn’t offer up all the answers. As much as we may be tempted to feel like we’ve got it all figured out, history has a bad habit of revealing the folly that belies this hubris.</p><p>After all, two Romans speaking a couple thousand years ago didn’t ask each other what year it was, only for one to tell the other, “We’re in the year -22 BCE, dummy!”</p><p>All this a long-winded way to say: people tend to lose sight of the future, or, to be more precise, never truly have it. Our ability to predict is pathetically unreliable as systems grow more complex. Case in point: computing power has grown exponentially, and yet we are still terrible at predicting weather. You’d think with all our developments we’d be able to see a massive hurricane before it forms, and yet this feat is presently considered functionally impossible.</p><p>For all the naysayers out there: criticism of new ideas, technologies and ways of building isn’t too new after all. People have a hard time predicting what will work, but hindsight is 20/20. Enjoy as we pit historical figures, living and otherwise, in a match of predictions in the Premonition Rumble!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="jbs-inaugural-premonition-rumble">JB’s Inaugural Premonition Rumble!<a class="hash-link" href="#jbs-inaugural-premonition-rumble" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="warren-buffet-versus-robert-metcalfe">Warren Buffet versus Robert Metcalfe<a class="hash-link" href="#warren-buffet-versus-robert-metcalfe" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>&quot;In terms of cryptocurrencies generally, I can say almost with certainty that they will come to a bad ending.” - Warren Buffet, 2019</p><p><em>vs</em></p><p>“I predict the Internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse.” — Robert Metcalfe, founder of 3Com, inventor of Ethernet, 1995</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="paul-krugman-versus-thomas-edison">Paul Krugman versus Thomas Edison<a class="hash-link" href="#paul-krugman-versus-thomas-edison" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>“Twelve years on, cryptocurrencies play almost no role in normal economic activity.

Unlike the physical environment of offices, cubicles, and maybe the occasional beanbag chair if you happen to work at one of those <em>fun</em> places, the online space where DAOs operate is free from constraints and incentives. It’s a space where people create for the sake of it, and pool effort together as a means of expression. Don’t get me wrong, there are plenty of endeavors out there that seek to make money, but the crucial difference is about what we call the bottom line, and what it looks like in a DAO space versus traditional settings.</p><p>Enter Cryptovoxels: an online space where participants can congregate, listen to music together, and even enjoy a “live” show in a virtual environment (pictured above). The Cryptovoxels space isn’t unique for what it is— plenty of paid spaces exist that try to achieve the same goal. The reason Cryptovoxels is unique is precisely for what it isn’t. It’s not about raising money, or pandering to users for shares and likes and what have you. It’s a space to wind down and enjoy together in a uniquely anti-consumerist experience. A space where creatives, programmers, technical writers, holders and any and all between can congregate for the sake of it.

In a traditional work environment or major corporation, somebody at the top may have an idea to create a space such as Cryptovoxels. From there, the idea would distill as it trickled down the workforce, ultimately culminating in strict directives and program managers. In other words, the project would itself become work— anathema to its very purpose!</p><p>In the DAOsphere, the whole process is put on its head. Eager community members, excited to contribute to a greater organization, and at times simply wanting to spin their wheels, generate projects such as Cryptovoxels not in order to make money, not in order to boast, not in order to monetize an experience, but, rather, simply to enjoy a moment— a happening, a vibe— with one another in a shared space. Where else can we say that this is the case?

They’re spaces that uniquely represent a way of thinking about the world and its members differently than before. They represent an open view of the world that seeks to collaborate into greater and greater projects without, importantly, treating everything in accordance with it’s bottom-line monetary value.</p><p>The era of web 3.0 is ushering in a way of thinking inclusively and openly about collaboration unlike anything we’ve seen before. The irony that the same Web 3.0 that brought us NFTs of just about everything can also bring us closer together in a completely non-exploitative way is rich, to be sure. But seeing this irony as a beauty, rather than a contradiction, is probably a better representation of the spirit of our times.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/dao">dao</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/observations">observations</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/year-of-the-dev">Year of the Dev</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-12-30T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">December 30, 2021</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/me_jango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1414958948189413395/l89bNR2m_400x400.jpg" alt="Jango"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/me_jango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Jango</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">JuiceboxDAO Contributor</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><ul><li>Devs aren&#x27;t just coders.

This rate currently decreases by 10% every other week. There is a proposal to push this up to 20%.</p><p>At the current redemption bonding curve of 60%, the protocol is offering 1 ETH back from the treasury for each <strong>679,652 JBX </strong>burned. There is a proposal to change this rate to 95%, at which the protocol would be offering 1 ETH for about <strong>459,219 JBX</strong> burned.</p><p>The price of JBX / ETH on Uniswap is currently <strong>446,380 JBX</strong> per 1 ETH traded.</p><p>JuiceboxDAO currently has a reserved rate of 35%, which means 112,495 new JBX get reserved per ETH contributed to the treasury alongside the amount issued for the contributor. 30% of this goes to the DAO (dao.jbx.eth), 24% to jango.eth, 24% to peri.eth, 7% to nnnnicholas.eth, 7% to exekias.eth, 4% to CanuDAO, and 4% to WAGMI Studios. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="observations">Observations<a class="hash-link" href="#observations" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>JBX is currently trading in between the issuance and the burn rates on off-protocol markets such as the Uniswap AMM. There&#x27;s currently no incentive for anyone to inflate or shrink the JBX supply.</li></ul><p>The protocol says nothing about what might happen off-protocol. The following are just my assumptions and not financial advice.  </p><ul><li>If the market price of JBX increases past the protocol&#x27;s issuance price, any additional demand of JBX can be fulfilled by contributing ETH to the Juicebox treasury which will in turn mint and distribute JBX.</li></ul><p>Risk taking arbitragers might be incentivized to mint extra JBX at this funding cycle&#x27;s rate to cover the 10% spread that will become available when the cycle rolls over and the discount takes effect. They can also benefit from information asymmetry by minting JBX to fill buy orders on off-protocol markets – <em>the JuiceboxDAO community should work to minimize the opportunity for information asymmetry</em>.</p><p>Either of these will benefit all JBX holders who have held their JBX from better rates during previous funding cycles – their share of the total JBX in circulation will shrink, but the ETH treasury that backs each JBX will grow at a faster rate, which has the effect of increasing the burn rate.</p><ul><li>If the price of JBX decreases past the protocol&#x27;s burn rate, further demand to sell JBX can be fulfilled by burning JBX to get ETH that is locked in the treasury&#x27;s overflow.</li></ul><p>Again, arbitragers can benefit from information asymmetry by burning JBX to fill sell orders on off-protocol markets – <em>again, the JuiceboxDAO community should work to minimize the opportunity for information asymmetry. </em></p><p>Either of these will benefit all JBX holders who chose to hold their JBX through the sell pressure – every JBX that is redeemed at a redemption bonding curve leaves some ETH on the table from its proportional share (60% curve leaves a lot more on the table for holders than a 95% curve, exaggerating the effect). In all cases except a 100% redemption curve, the JBX circulating supply will be decreasing at a faster rate than the treasury&#x27;s ETH supply. This will marginally increase the burn rate for JBX with each subsequent burn, which will add upward pressure on prices, shrink supply, and leave only the holders that turned away the potentially mounting exit incentive to keep building. </p><ul><li>Over time as the market pushes against the issue and burn rates, a JBX holder&#x27;s burn rate will increase and might eventually exceed the value that the JBX was minted at. </li></ul><p>The more pressure on either side, the more the burn rate increases for each holder. On the other hand, the burn rate will stay the same if the market is being satisfied off protocol.</p><p>Tail market events benefit JBX holders most, albeit in a contained and measured way. The only thing that does not benefit JBX holders is the lack of change in JBX demand over time. Under this mechanism, it seems we are sacrificing price swings for resiliency.</p><ul><li>The DAO is spending ETH each funding cycle to pay out contributors, services, and grants as proposals get approved by JBX holders. The impact of this spending is spread across all JBX holders, marginally reducing everyone&#x27;s burn rate. </li></ul><p>The DAO could also allocate ETH off-platform in its multisig wallet or various other contracts across web3. This value is currently impossible to account for in the burn rate given the current version of the Juicebox protocol.</p><ul><li><p>The reserved token list only captures value when the token supply is growing. Once token supply has expanded and the market is satisfied off protocol, reserved token holders are massively incentivized to push the price up towards its limit. </p></li><li><p>It is expensive to mint 51% of all tokens in existence, even without a reserved rate. If this were to happen, the ETH used to mint the token majority would immediately fund an increased burn rate for every token holder from previous cycles. The new influential JBX holder would have to appease a community with potentially significant exit incentive.</p></li></ul><p>This same effect exists if the 51% is bought all-of-the-sudden by thousands of uncoordinated people on the internet.</p><ul><li>The DAO (dao.jbx.eth) currently receives 30% of reserved JBX tokens. The DAO is considering committing a percent of this built up supply to circulate among contributors via the DAO&#x27;s discord. </li></ul><p>It can do so in many ways, one approach is to split the allocation among the addresses on the reserved list, who are then encouraged to split this initial supply entirely between those who they work closest with and who&#x27;s contributions they want to recognize. Those recipients are in turn encouraged to continue circulating this supply. </p><p>The goal is to make sure everyone who is building and maintaining the protocol and ecosystem becomes significant JBX token holders that can formally help the DAO make decisions.</p><p>If this internal JBX distribution system increases the governance participation of new builders and of those who steward the protocol, then the DAO may benefit from expanding this program by increasing the portion of reserved tokens allocated to the DAO treasury, and reducing the reserved token allocation to other recipients.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/observations">observations</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/notice-juicebox-fundraise">NOTICE: Juicebox V1 inefficiencies</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-11-27T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">November 27, 2021</time> · <!-- -->One min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/me_jango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1414958948189413395/l89bNR2m_400x400.jpg" alt="Jango"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/me_jango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Jango</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">JuiceboxDAO Contributor</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Before you start a project on Juicebox V1 or contribute funds to one, understand the following inefficiencies.

I&#x27;m guessing most projects would prefer to operate everywhere, if only it were easy to do so.</p></blockquote><p>What if the simplest option was the best option?</p><p>Although deploying the same Juicebox protocol in each EVM compatible L2 environment forces projects to choose which they would like to operate on, it might be most reasonable to pass along this choice and complexity to each project while suggesting thorough operational strategies to weave these isolated environments together at the DAO/social/governance layer.</p><p>Here are some potential operational guidelines, using JuiceboxDAO as an example:</p><ul><li>Juicebox protocol is deployed identically on several L2s and side chains. JuiceboxDAO creates a project on each one where fees will be collected and contributions accepted.</li><li>JuiceboxDAO will have different tokens on each chain. JuiceboxDAO membership is composed of a strategy that take each of these tokens into account. Members are responsible for managing the entirety of the DAO&#x27;s treasury across all chains.</li><li>JuiceboxDAO submits treasury reconfigurations to each chain independently. Each chain can have funding cycles that operate on different schedules, have different token issuance rates, and different ETH distributions. This flexibility can be used to orchestrate arbitrary multi-chain treasury designs, although also introducing management overhead.

This forces projects to choose which they would like to operate on, or manage their own complexity if they would like to operate across many. I&#x27;m guessing most projects would prefer to operate everywhere, if only it were easy to do so.</p><p>JuiceboxDAO runs on the juicebox protocol itself, if we do nothing at the protocol layer and go with this simple option we will come across the same dilemma. If instead we preemptively consider how we can adjust the Juicebox V2 protocol to make cross layer operation simple for us, we&#x27;ll likely also be making it simple for all projects who choose to build around juicebox treasuries.</p><p>An effective solution will take into consideration that:</p><ul><li><strong>projects do not want to fragment its community and governance across chains.</strong> All members should be cheering for funds to come in from wherever people care to contribute from, and the project&#x27;s distributed tokens in turn should provide the opportunity to govern its cumulative funds regardless of what chain they&#x27;re on. </li><li><strong>the issuance rate of the project&#x27;s tokens should be synchronizable across all available environments over time.</strong> As funding cycles roll over, it&#x27;s often the case that the weight of token distribution changes. Unless it is by design, there shouldn&#x27;t be arbitrage opportunities across chains. </li><li><strong>funding cycle reconfigurations should either be approved or fail across all environments.</strong> If a project proposes to reconfigure its funding parameters in one environment but the ballot to do so ends up failing, the change should also fail to take effect in all other environments. On the flip side, successful funding cycle reconfigurations should be reflected across chains.</li></ul><hr><p><em>Stay tuned for specific proposals from me of how this might be achieve across rollup L2s, and please contribute to the conversation with your own ideas so we can arrive at the best possible set of solutions together.</em></p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/protocol">protocol</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/observations">observations</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/constitutiondao-refund-brainstorm">Potential ways to handle the ConstitutionDAO refund</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-11-19T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">November 19, 2021</time> · <!-- -->6 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/me_jango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1414958948189413395/l89bNR2m_400x400.jpg" alt="Jango"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/me_jango" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Jango</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">JuiceboxDAO Contributor</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>thoughts in progress. feedback always welcome. plz add to the conversation and let me know if i&#x27;m missing some context, it can be hard to keep up with it all.</em></p><p>ConstitutionDAO has reached some sort of a coordination moment.

Currently, 35% of these are reserved and allocated to preprogrammed addresses while the remaining 65% are sent to the contributor of the payment. </p><p>The current distribution of reserved tokens for JuiceboxDAO is as follows:
<img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image-5-891bec90adcfd3d96bf1ba8a6626d9a9.png" width="1084" height="672" class="img_ev3q">
There is no cap to how many JBX are minted into existence: as more ETH is contributed, more JBX is created, albeit at a slightly decreasing rate over time due to the discount rate (currently 10% fewer JBX minted per ETH every 2 weeks). With each payment, the pie being shared grows while everyone&#x27;s share of the pie slightly shrinks.</p><p>... except for those on the reserved tokens list. At any given moment, their overall JBX positions tend towards the percent of reserved tokens they&#x27;re programmed to receive, at the rate of the treasury&#x27;s growth. This also means that currently 35% of the DAO&#x27;s value tends to concentrate between the reserved token holders, with the remaining 65% going to a long-tail distribution between those who chipped in or paid fees to the treasury over time, favoring those who did so soonest. </p><p>JuiceboxDAO&#x27;s reserved tokens have thus far been mostly allocated to those few contributors shouldering operational responsibilities to the DAO. Recently the DAO also began reserving tokens for the DAO&#x27;s multi-sig in order to redistribute to LP staking rewards and other programs. </p><p>Going forward, the DAO&#x27;s greatest opportunity to coordinate incentives among its community will likely come through expanding the reserved pool to include many new members and campaigns with proven commitments to its success, as well as smaller scoped experimental distributions.</p><p>With a few basic guardrails and guidances in place such as those outlined in the <a href="https://juiceboxdao.notion.site/Governance-f0ff06c503914500acb9bd646cc4ed65" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DAO&#x27;s governance documents</a>, the DAO should be set up to fairly and efficiently welcome in meaningful contributors, while shedding those who are no longer participating or useful. This process should spread the value the DAO creates to the people actively furthering the project&#x27;s mission statement, and to the projects building on the protocol who are paying fees over time.</p><p>I&#x27;m very eager to see more reserved token allocation <a href="https://juiceboxdao.notion.site/Governance-f0ff06c503914500acb9bd646cc4ed65" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proposals</a> over the next several months, and for the number of reserved token receivers to grow substantially.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="aside">Aside<a class="hash-link" href="#aside" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The reserved rate also makes a 51% takeover very expensive. JuiceboxDAO currently has a total supply of 577,516,558 JBX tokens. Each ETH contributed mints another 544,320 JBX (353,808 to the payer, 190,512 to the reserved pool). In order for someone to mint 51% of tokens for themselves today, they would have to dump 3,865 ETH into the treasury. This will just get more expensive as time goes on since the total supply will increase over time as the number of tokens minted per ETH contributed decreases.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/observations">observations</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/blog/tags/observations/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div></div>
