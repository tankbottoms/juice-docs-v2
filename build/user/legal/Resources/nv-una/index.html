a Nevada nonprofit
GUIDING PRINCIPLES</p><p>These guiding principles constitute an Agreement (hereinafter the &quot;Agreement&quot;) and are entered into by and amongst members of TreasuryDAO (hereinafter “DAO” or “Treasury”), an unincorporated nonprofit association organized under the laws of the State of Nevada. <strong>The following terms apply when you click to view or access DAO&#x27;s Decentralized Application (or &quot;Dapp&quot;) or DAO&#x27;s other online services, contribute Ethereum via <a href="https://juicebox.money" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://juicebox.money</a> (or via any project hosted therein, or <a href="https://juicebox.wtf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://juicebox.wtf</a>), become a Member of the DAO, receive DAO Tokens, hold Governance Rights for Treasury, interact with or access Treasury&#x27;s smart contracts in any way, provide services to Treasury, donate or transfer any property to Treasury, or otherwise interact with or access Treasury&#x27;s services through the Dapp. By doing any of the above, you signify your agreement to these terms.</strong> If you do not agree to be bound by the Agreement in its entirety, you may not access, interact with, or use Treasury. Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings ascribed to them in Section 17.</p><p>Organization</p><p>(a) Formation. Treasury was formed on August 7, 2021. The duties and obligations of the Members of the DAO shall be determined pursuant to the Revised Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act of 2008 (the &quot;Act&quot;), NRS §§ 81.700 to 81.890 inclusive, and this Agreement.</p><p>(b) Purpose. <strong>The primary purpose of the DAO is to build and create a blockchain-native treasury focused on the accounting and governance of other treasuries for the same purpose.</strong> The DAO shall have the power to do any and all acts appropriate, convenient, desirable, incidental, or necessary to or in furtherance of the purposes described in this Agreement, including, without limitation, any and all of the powers that may be exercised on behalf of the DAO by its members. The DAO shall not engage in profit-making activities. Any profits that are incidentally accrued or earned from any of the DAO&#x27;s activities will be used or set aside for the DAO&#x27;s nonprofit purposes.</p><p>Membership; Governance Rights and Tokens; Limitations</p><p>(a) Governance Rights. Governance Rights in the DAO are represented by cryptographically secured tokens (&quot;Tokens&quot;), with each Token representing a fractional part of the Governance Rights of all Members (or assignees, as the case may be) equal to the quotient of one (1) divided by the total number of Tokens claimed at any time.</p><p><strong>(b) Tokens. As of the date hereof, Tokens authorized to represent membership interests in the DAO. The DAO shall provide to each Member One Million (1,000,000) Tokens for each Ethereum donated to the DAO, unless otherwise agreed to by the Members via a vote occurring through the Dapp. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, the DAO shall provide the members in Exhibit A and members of its technical partners, Two Hundred Thousands (200,000) Tokens, each, for their role in conceiving and supporting the DAO.<!-- -->*</strong></p><p>(c) Governance Rights and Token Limitations. Possession or ownership of any of the Tokens issued by the DAO do not provide any right of ownership or management of the DAO and does no provide the holder of a token any possibility of a profit, nor any right to a future distribution or dividends paid by the DAO. By entering this Agreement each Member (or assignees, as the case may be) who receives or holds governance Tokens expressly and unequivocally agrees that the Tokens provide no rights to an expectation of profit, no entitlement to distributions or dividends from the DAO, and no right of ownership or management of the DAO.</p><p>Liability</p><p>(a) No Member Liability. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or the Act, no Member (or former Member) shall be personally liable for the obligations of the DAO, including any obligations owed by such Member in connection with any breach of this Agreement. A debt, obligation, or other liability of the DAO is solely the debt, obligation, or other liability of the DAO. Members (or former Members) are not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of contribution or otherwise, for a debt, obligation, or other liability of the DAO solely by reason of being or acting as a Member or acting on behalf of the DAO. The failure of the DAO to observe formalities relating to the exercise of its powers or management of its activities and affairs is not grounds for imposing liability on a Member of the DAO for a debt, obligation, or other liability of the DAO.</p><p>(b) Member Limitations. No Member shall have the right or power: (i) to cause the dissolution and winding up of the DAO; or (ii) to demand or receive property, including any NFTs donated to the DAO, except as agreed to by the Members or otherwise provided herein.</p><p>Admission of Additional Members</p><p>(a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Members are authorized to accept additional donations from one or more Members, and to admit other Persons to the DAO as additional Members (each such additional Member and such existing Member an &quot;Additional Member&quot;). Unless otherwise determined by the Members, any such Additional Members shall be admitted to the DAO only if such Member or Additional Member makes a donation via the Dapp.</p><p>(b) Accession to Agreement. Each Person who is to be admitted as an Additional Member pursuant to this Agreement shall agree to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement as if they were a member from the inception of the DAO.</p><p>Management</p><p>(a) Except as otherwise expressly required in this Agreement, the affairs of the DAO shall be carried on and managed exclusively by the Members, who shall have sole and absolute discretion with respect thereto. No Member shall be a manager, as defined under the Act.</p><p>(b) Whenever any action, including any approval, consent, decision, determination, or resolution is to be taken or given by the Members or the DAO under this Agreement or under the Act, it shall be authorized by a vote of the Members via the Dapp, unless otherwise provided herein. Such an authorization may be evidenced by a vote facilitated via the Dapp and one or more smart contracts, or by a written consent, in accordance with this Agreement. The Members intend that any action (which has been duly approved in accordance with this Agreement) taken by the DAO via a Dapp, a smart contract or the blockchain, shall be a valid action of the Members or the DAO, as applicable, and no Member shall challenge the authority or validity of any such action based solely upon such fact.</p><p>(c) Except as otherwise expressly required in this Agreement or in the Act, no single Member (in their capacity as a Member) shall have authority to bind the DAO in any way or to enter into any agreement or contract obligating the DAO in any way unless approved via a vote of the Members occurring through the Dapp.</p><p>(d) To the extent that the Members have approved a document in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Act, any Member can be expressly authorized to execute and deliver such document on behalf of the DAO.</p><p>(e) Members may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the Member with regards to the any vote taken by the DAO via Dapp or any other action taken by the DAO on behalf of that Member.</p><p>(f) The DAO has the right to delegate or retain third parties or independent contractors to perform certain technical or administrative responsibilities and provide them with reasonable compensation.</p><p>(g) Reliance by Third Parties. Persons dealing with the DAO are entitled to rely conclusively upon the power and authority of the Members (and any Person to whom the Members delegated any such power and authority pursuant to this Agreement) and acknowledge that such Member or designee is authorized to act on behalf of the DAO and may bind the DAO or otherwise enter into a binding contract.</p><p>(h) Other Activities.
