New subgraph is currently indexing the mainnet, now it\u2019s a waiting game that needs logical coordination to get things to happen. Once that\u2019s in, we are basically ready to launch V2 on mainnet. The good thing is, that the launch is not a one-way door, if we have major issues, we can always switch back to V1 to fix the issues and switch back to V2 after that.

It\u2019s a set of contracts that allow folks to list NFT with the sales routed through a particular Juicebox treasury or a set of treasuries. The goal of this project is, instead of having the pay button as the way to pay projects, anyone could upload an NFT that could basically serve as the pay button. Someone could just buy the NFT and the funds would be routed to the treasury. This is in effect a more engaging pay button that is extended to do the NFT related treasury things.

People can roll their treasuries and migrate between terminals. Might be interesting to be right off the bat, before some happenings or pressure, to migrate from one terminal to another slightly optimized one. This is not really a big deal but more so to get the cadence of feeling confident in how we might organize files.

In V1 we had handles for projects which is great in the short term, but it has a whole lot we need to think about for a long-term perspective. In V2, we just started with project IDs, so that people can build things on top of it.
