"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"@peri"),": I think as everybody knows we still aren't supporting project handles for the new V2 projects. And this is basically just has to do with some of the changes that are made in the contracts. We used to store a handle for a project on chain and it requires a lot of extra finessing in the contracts because we had to make sure that people can use the same contract and that handles could be transferred and reserved for certain period of time and claimed, there's a lot of functionalities to bake in. So with the V2 project contracts, we just skipped over all that because it ended up not being very necessary for the functionality of the contracts themselves. But the downside of course is that it's really nice to have in the app to be able to look up projects and search for projects."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"So we've been working on another layer, another contract to add into the existing contracts that will support handles for V2 projects.

And we are going to set a handle for this project. "),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"We've got a two-transaction-process for setting a project handle. And so the way that this works is we decided to use ENS names to handle the uniqueness of project handles what I mentioned earlier for making sure that handles be passed around and exchanged. There's a lot of complexity there that ENS has already solved really beautifully and so we built the system around ENS names. The idea here is that if you want to use a handle for a project you will need to own the matching ENS name. So for example, I just got this ENS name on rinkby testinginprod.eth and this would allow me to set the handle of this project to testinginprod. So I'm gonna do two steps here,"),(0,a.kt)("ol",null,(0,a.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"I have to own this ENS name first of course,  I'm going to set the ENS name testinginprod.eth and this would be one transaction. Once this completes, step one will be done."),(0,a.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"The next step here is to actually set a text record on the ENS name. So if anybody's used the ENS name app before you'll know that you can come down and set these text records for any number of different things. We are using a particular key \"Juicebox project ID\". You can come and set this property in the ENS name app manually if you want, but that's a little bit of extra work. So we've made it nice, pretty and clean in the app and you can basically come down here and click this button and we're gonna set that value in the ENS name text record to the ID of this project. So this one is 4117. So I'm going to send this transaction, which is the same as if I just came over here and just manually put 4117 here. That'll show up here if you got the handle set up.")),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"Most importantly that'll allow your project to be searched on the projects page. Right now the search bar works by searching for project handles and V2 projects don't have handles you can't search for them. It's very lame that is now a thing of the past as soon as you set a handle for your project. Your project will be searchable. "),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"An important thing to note is that either of these things change, for example if you were to transfer the ENS name and someone else changes that text record, your handle will go back to empty. So you have to have both of these things set constantly or if you were to change this to some other ENS name, your handle would go back to empty."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"Another fun fact is you can also actually do subdomains here.

I've been doing some work on the subgraph implementation to index the user tokens and interact with them. Right now we had a couple of big steps forward. One thing is there's now a metadata file to parse for all the the characters or the variants so you can go through and scroll through the characters and figure out which one you want and then you can see them all in here, too.
