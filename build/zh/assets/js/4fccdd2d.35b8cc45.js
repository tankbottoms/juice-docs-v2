Generally when I want to dive into something, I really wanna get into the nuts/bolts and learn it from the ground up. I finally found myself with the time to do that, and me and a couple friends found this NFT project we liked, and even though we couldn\u2019t really afford to buy the NFT separately, if we pull our funds together\u2026 and it was like a lightbulb moment. We thought hey, what about this whole DAO thing happening\u2014 what if we make a DAO that buys some NFTs. So I found JB and started poking around, and it was coincidentally the same time that ConstitutionDAO was happening. I was drawn in by the amazing branding of Banny (a banana smoking a joint was just amazing) and the next day I wake up, log into discord, and I see the treasury has grown to like 20 million overnight.

The protocol guys said let\u2019s start developing V2 and improve it from the ground up, and so the front-end\u2019s job in that is basically to support those new additions. There\u2019s exciting potential use cases, like funding your project through your own NFT launch, or like a project that comes along that says we want to award contributors with an NFT that they can sell on secondary market, and the proceeds of those NFTs will go straight into a JB treasury.
