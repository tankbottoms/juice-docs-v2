I have zero technical background so as you can probably imagine...I had no clue what any of them were talking about.  I can't remember exactly when I joined, but probably around October '21.  The discord was still pretty small, I think we there were max 5-6 people on town hall calls so it was very close knit but very welcoming to normies like myself (which to be honest, it's still a pretty tight group of contributors who are also still very welcoming imo even though the membership has grown quite a lot)!  I started slowly but surely participating, asking questions (even \"dumb\" ones),  then ultimately took on a pm role to help keep people moving in a forward direction and tasks from slipping through cracks.  Since I joined, JB has definitely matured.  Processes have been dialed in, incredible work teams have come together, grown and transitioned into their own DOAs  (amazing!), and the synergy in how, so many people, from all over the world is nothing less than awe inspiring!
