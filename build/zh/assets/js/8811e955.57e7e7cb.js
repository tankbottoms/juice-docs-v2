JB is fairly complicated, so over the months we were constantly reshaping it, so the vision was changing as well. About 2-3 months before we launched I started to think about it and realized how valuable it would be to DAOs. While we were building it, DAO\u2019s were only just starting to become big. I felt like, somebody could use this not just as a business or to create a fundraiser, but can create a community of people, and that\u2019s when I felt like JB really came into its own and found itself.

From day 1 I was pushing code to fix small bugs and also thinking of these big-picture things, so I had wanted for a while a team to be able to help out with some of that workload. It was really beautiful because it was a time of wondering how to get those people in here, and I wondered: is this what a recruiting process looks like, do I need to be advertising positions, interviewing people and so on? That whole process is not something I was very excited or eager about, so I was just like, \u201cHopefully there will be people who find the project interesting and show up to help out\u201d\u2013 and that ended up being exactly what happened! JohnnyD, Aeolian, Torvusbug, Ooyoo were some of the major early contributors and with them we kicked into high gear.

So you can kinda start there as an organization that raises money, but obviously the big differences you have to jump to is issuance of tokens, what that means, the programmability of it all, the restriction on money withdrawal and to whom.

And the consequence of that is if there\u2019s ideas thrown out and talked about that aren\u2019t fitting with the momentum of the DAO, then it tends to be squashed.

Also fascinating: they\u2019ve always been fairly close votes when these issues have arisen.
