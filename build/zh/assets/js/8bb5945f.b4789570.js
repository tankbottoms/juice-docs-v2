As part of subscription to this offering, the Vehicle, the Administrative Member, or their designees may disclose subscriber\u2019s income tax return information to certain other affiliated entities or third-party service providers for tax return preparation and data aggregation purposes.

The Subscriber may submit notice to the Administrative Member. The Subscriber\u2019s consent is considered withdrawn on the date the Vehicle receives the written request to withdraw consent.
