Nouns are 32x32 pixel characters with heads that represent a noun like \u201cigloo,\u201d \u201cskateboard,\u201d or \u201cpeanut.\u201d One Noun is auctioned every twenty-four hours, forever, with all proceeds going to the Nouns treasury. When one auction is settled, the next Noun is generated and a new auction begins. Each Noun is entitled to one vote in Nouns DAO governance which decides how the treasury should be used.  \\n\\nAuction bids for Nouns can easily reach over 100 ETH. As a result, owning a Noun is often limited to those that can afford to win these competitive auctions\u2026 unless you\u2019re a member of SharkDAO \u2310\u25e8-\u25e8  \\n\\n### SharkDAO, a shiver of Nouns enthusiasts \ud83e\udd88  \\n\\nDid you know that a group of sharks is called a shiver? SharkDAO brings together Nouns enthusiasts with the shared goal of acquiring Nouns and contributing to the Nouns ecosystem. Together they pool funds, participate in Nouns DAO governance, and partner with artists, developers, and DAOs to create Nounish experiences. This has taken the form of [podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/meet-the-sharks/id1605492563), [NFT collaborations](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/95967798888951567848103900867485523214406787411953560656221044242283845648484), and Nouns DAO proposals like [e-sports initiatives](https://nouns.wtf/vote/68) and [CC0 Story Bibles](https://nouns.wtf/vote/70).  \\n\\nThey currently hold six Nouns: 2, 5, 15, 33, 47, and 139 which have been named by the Shark community as follows:  \\n\\n\ud83c\udf4d\xa0Noun 2: Pi\xf1a, named after its pineapple head  \\n\\n\ud83e\ude9a\xa0Noun 5: Bruce, a reference to actor Bruce Campbell who wields a chainsaw in the movie [The Evil Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evil_Dead)  \\n\\n\ud83d\udc8a\xa0Noun 15: Morpheus, based on Laurence Fishburne\u2019s character from [The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise))  \\n\\n\ud83d\udc38\xa0Noun 33: Froger, named after its frog head  \\n\\n\ud83e\udd88\xa0Noun 47: Swimshady, the cool alter ego of the Shark Noun  \\n\\n\ud83d\udd12\xa0Noun 139: Paddy, named after its padlock-shaped head  \\n\\n![Left to right: Nouns 15, 2, 33, 47, 5 and 139](shark-gang.png)  \\n<p class=\\"subtitle\\">Left to right: Nouns 15, 2, 33, 47, 5 and 139</p>\\n\\n### Building the plane while you fly it  \\n\\nAs an experiment in on-chain avatar communities, Nouns DAO\u2019s mission is to spread the Nounish word with the help of Nouns holders who make up the voting body of the DAO.\\n\\n> While projects such as CryptoPunks have attempted to bootstrap digital community and identity, Nouns attempt to bootstrap identity, community, governance, and a treasury that can be used by the community for the creation of long-term value.\\n>\\n\\n\u2014 [Punk 4156](https://twitter.com/punk4156)\\n\\nHolding only 6/300+ votes might not seem like much, but lurking beneath the waters SharkDAO is active in discussions, pushing ideas through the ecosystem, and able to get a lot more done than what their voting power implies. Since Nouns has no roadmap from the Nounders (founders), Nouns is community-owned which gives power to holders to propose initiatives and decide how to use treasury funds. In other words, the task of building community and shaping the future of Nouns belongs to community members who hold Nouns, rather than the founders. SharkDAO, as one of only a handful of sub-DAOs within Nouns DAO, is one of the groups building this roadmap on-the-fly.\\n\\n> \u201cIn short, sub-DAOs participation in a DAO is shaping and contributing a voice to that community so that the best ideas get surfaced, voted on, and make an impact in the world.\u201d\\n>\\n\\n\u2014 [Dropnerd](https://twitter.com/dropnerdETH)\\n\\n![SharkDAO and NounsDAO infographic from sharsk.wtf](sharkdao-infographic.png)  \\n<p class=\\"subtitle\\">SharkDAO and NounsDAO visualization from <a href=\\"https://sharks.wtf\\">sharks.wtf</a></p>\\n\\n### SharkDAO, the meme that jumped from Rinkeby to mainnet  \\n\\nIt all started with a small group of frens helping Nouns DAO test out their auction mechanism before it went live. [Goldy](https://twitter.com/Goldypix), [4156](https://twitter.com/punk4156), [Dropnerd](https://twitter.com/dropnerdETH), [Lithium](https://twitter.com/LithiumXBT), [Kenbot](https://twitter.com/kenbot), [Del Piero](https://twitter.com/iamDelPiero) and [Defi Jesus](https://twitter.com/eldefijesus) were a few of these early swimmers. The Shark Noun was one of the first Nouns that was acquired on testnet by the group and they decided to build around that Shark identity. They launched a [Discord](http://discord.gg/QNbuygdK3A), started bringing in contributors, and began planning how they were going to crowdfund to buy Nouns.\\n\\n![A tweet by 4156 after the Rinkeby shark was acquired](rinkeby-shark-4156.png)  \\n<p class=\\"subtitle\\"><a href=\\"https://twitter.com/punk4156\\">4156</a> announcing that the Rinkeby shark was acquired (<a href=\\"https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1417277461100957703?s=20&t=l-tAx4IAz5kLmhNhKFdNyQ\\">tweet</a>)</p>\\n\\n> SharkDAO is a meme that jumped from Rinkeby to mainnet.\u201d  \\n>  \\n\\n\u2014 [Kenbot](https://twitter.com/kenbot) in a [Twitter Space](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1BRKjnZpLdjKw?s=20) hosted by [nnnnicholas](https://twitter.com/nnnnicholas)  \\n\\nWhen it came to figuring out how to fundraise in order to bid on the first Noun, [Kenny](https://twitter.com/kenbot) dives into the Discord and suggests a cool project he heard of called Juicebox. Building a treasury on Juicebox would allow the group to trustlessly raise funds and manage their treasury, without the risks of YOLO\u2019ing ETH into a multi-sig.  \\n\\n![SharkDAO project page on Juicebox](sharkdao-jb.png)  \\n<p class=\\"subtitle\\">SharkDAO <a href=\\"https://juicebox.money/#/p/sharkdao\\">project page</a> on Juicebox</p>\\n\\nFrom there, SharkDAO set up a Juicebox project on Rinkeby. Dropnerd was doing the testing and was still new to signing transactions. \u201cI was very excited to see everything come together so easily without needing to interact with a bunch of smart contracts directly,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe UI showed me exactly what was going on which made it a lot easier for the DAO. Looking back I can\u2019t think of another platform where we could have raised 200+ ETH in the first few days without the help of Juicebox.  \\n\\n### SharkDAO catching the Shark Noun \ud83c\udfa3  \\n\\n![Noun #47: The Shark Noun.](swim-shady.svg)  \\n<p class=\\"subtitle\\"><a href=\\"https://nouns.wtf/noun/47\\">Noun 47</a>, the Shark Noun</p>\\n\\nAlthough new Nouns may seem random and impossible to predict, their traits are actually determined by the previous blockhash. And if you\u2019re particularly clever, you can use the crystal ball to predict and even choose the next Noun that will be generated \ud83d\udd2e  \\n\\nBefore the Shark Noun was generated, founding member [Goldy](https://twitter.com/Goldypix) was eyeing the [Noun Crystal Ball](https://nouns-crystal-ball.netlify.app/) every day for weeks. This magical tool shows you what the next Noun will look like if the auction is settled on the current block by calling the `settleCurentAndCreateNewAuction()` function in the `NounsAuctionHouse` [contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF15a943787014461d94da08aD4040f79Cd7c124e).  \\n\\nUsually the winning bidder will settle the auction, but anyone can call `settleCurentAndCreateNewAuction()` at a particular block and help decide what the next Noun will look like. In a glimpse of a moment, Goldy saw the Shark Noun in the Crystal Ball and [submitted the transaction](0xba8560127d046bb5b2c92cae027a8741f3301975ef37752e23e3b3b1e565cd07) before the next block to secure it.    \\n\\n![The Noun Crystal Ball \ud83d\udd2e](crystal-ball.png)  \\n<p class=\\"subtitle\\">The Noun Crystal Ball \ud83d\udd2e</p>\\n\\nSharkDAO had to act fast if they wanted the Shark Noun. The DAO established an auction committee, re-opened their Juicebox project, and expanded their multi-sig to include 5 members. Within the first few days of re-opening for contributions, they received over \u039e150 from community members.  \\n\\n### Where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a wave \ud83c\udf0a  \\n\\nThe team suspected that someone was watching within the DAO and took their calls offline to discuss the details of their strategy in real time, including their final bid number. It wasn\u2019t an easy auction to win though: the Shark Noun was desired by many and led to a *jawesome* bidding war. Over the next 24 hours the bidding quickly went past \u039e100 and then \u039e200 soon after. It became clear that the price of Noun 47 was going to swim past most Nouns auctions, apart from the very first Noun that sold for \u039e600. After their penultimate bid of \u039e244.82, SharkDAO was getting pretty close to exhausting the amount that they set aside for the auction. Though winning Noun #47 was non-negotiable, they also needed to conserve enough treasury funds to ensure that the DAO could continue to build into the future.\\n\\n![Timeline of some of the final bids on the auction for Noun 47.](noun47-bids.png)  \\n<p class=\\"subtitle\\">Timeline of some of the final bids on the auction for Noun 47.</p>\\n\\nIf a bid is placed in the last five minutes of an auction, the timer is extended by another five minutes. Due to the cumbersome nature of bidding via a Gnosis Safe, the DAO came pretty close to losing the shark. There was even one bid where the last signer was executing the transaction with only 45 seconds left on the clock.\\n\\nAfter a [last minute bid](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x84366348b21453396194567271bf0f575a17bf48f4e66e0b4c0f29d54e119fbc) of \u039e258.88 by 0xa8...0e7d, the team had minutes to coordinate and agree on the next bid price before multisig signers could approve the transaction. And on September 21, 2021 at 2:19am, SharkDAO [won the final bid for 269.69 ETH](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1f60d7ddc1cf1e627984bfc431c62dc4f7f28ab2b377b9ad2db0d21327e627e0).  \\n\\n![Noun #47: The Shark Noun](noun47.png)  \\n<p class=\\"subtitle\\">Noun 47, the Shark Noun</p>\\n\\n### SharkDAO celebrates their shark-versary  \\n\\nSince their launch on August 8th, 2021, [SharkDAO](https://juicebox.money/#/p/sharkdao) has raised over 1000 ETH on Juicebox, acquired six Nouns, and brought together over 400 sharks. As a sub-DAO, they\u2019ve pushed several proposals over the *fin-ish* line in the Nouniverse including [Nouns-based short films](https://nouns.wtf/vote/20) and [FOMO Nouns](https://nouns.wtf/vote/8). SharkDAO has also [helped provide eye exams and glasses to thousands of kids in need](https://nouns.wtf/vote/104), donated 5 ETH to the [Coral Restoration Foundation](https://www.coralrestoration.org/crypto-donations/), and started a new [Juicebox project](https://juicebox.money/#/p/sharkfrens) to raise 60+ ETH for founding member [Del Piero](https://twitter.com/iamDelPiero)\u2019s son\u2019s leukemia treatment.  \\n\\nThe Shark Noun has become an icon and remains one of the most recognizable Nouns. In a particularly surreal turn of events, Noun #47 aka Swim Shady was featured in Yuga Labs\u2019 [Otherside promo video](https://twitter.com/yugalabs/status/1505014986556551172?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1505014986556551172%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.todayscrypto.news%2Fotherside-yuga-labs-metaverse-lands-in-april%2F) alongside Cryptopunks, Cool Cats, CrypToadz, World of Women, and Meebits. Not only were Nouns included as one of a handful of projects to represent NFTs a whole, but the Shark Noun was chosen as its iconic ambassador.  \\n\\nWhat\u2019s next for SharkDAO? Stay tuned for future NounsDAO proposals like the [Monthly Nouns Comics project](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/monthly-nouns-comics-for-mass-market-release-v2/1717) currently being developed by DefaultedUser and [ComicsDAO](https://www.juicebox.money/v2/p/31) in collaboration with SharkDAO.

For hours and hours I would build, design, and arrange anything I could think up. Unbound by the limits of gravity, money, or even common sense, *The Sims* was an excuse to imagine what was possible rather than what was realistic. At the time this maybe seemed like a silly diversion, but like many of our early internet activities this turned out to be great practice for the future that was hurdling towards us. Spending hours customizing a Myspace page was, in retrospect, a great introduction to frontend development. And perhaps The Sims was the perfect introduction to metaverse architecture.\\n\\n![Old Town, The Sims](old-town.png)\\n\\n<p class=\\"subtitle\\">Old Town in The Sims (2000)</p>\\n\\n### Lexicon Devils origin story  \\n\\n[Lexicon Devils](https://juicebox.money/#/p/lexicondevils), named after an EP by LA punk rock band Germs, is a guild of metaverse builders architecting virtual experiences in Voxels, Substrata, and beyond.

In other words: \u201cI know you don\u2019t know us, but let\u2019s hang out.\u201d Building in the open with a trustless, transparent treasury means easily building friendships and communities regardless of identity or credentials.

It\u2019s easy. Just start with a DAO with a large, strong community!\\n\\nOkay, all kidding aside, if you are serious about venturing into the worlds of DAO creation, read on to learn some tips and tricks to ensure that your DAO delivers on its full potential!\\n\\n### Build a community\\n\\nWhether your DAO is doing NFT minting, creating tokens for governance, bringing together a global community around a shared goal or interest, or just there to further some unique idea of yours, you\u2019re going to need a community. The problem? Not all communities are created equal, and many of them struggle to find their footing in the hustle and bustle of web3.\\n\\nFinding good community members isn\u2019t easy, but keeping them in the long run can be even harder. If your DAO has no way to compensate good community members or suffers from lack of coordinate or mission-alignment issues, you will likely find qualified people sticking around briefly and moving on. Consider thinking carefully about your mission and about a way to make it enthralling for new members. Sell the idea, and show how that idea will benefit your contributors or the planet at large. Don\u2019t be afraid to say no, and have your mission well thought-out before you open a discord and start trying to attract new members.\\n\\n### Decide on governance that works NOW\\n\\nMany different [governance](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/great-web3-governance-at-a-glance) systems exist, including 1-member-1-vote, quadratic voting, voting-by-tokens-held, and many more. Think carefully about how you\u2019d like your own DAO to operate. Do you want everyone to have equal participation and inclusion? Then perhaps one-member-one-vote is the way to go. Or do you want certain members to have voting power because they are part of a core group? Do you want votes to pass with a 51% majority, or higher?\\n\\nThese are all important questions to consider. If you want a DAO that is more resistant to change, you may consider putting a voting threshold very high, for instance around 75% or above. This would ensure that only when the vast majority of your members agree on something that it will change.\\n\\nIf you want your DAO to morph quickly with changing times, you may decide to drop your voting threshold lower than 50%. This can also open you open to having your DAO hijacked by an influx of new members, so beware!\\n\\nRegarding votes, how do you want people\u2019s voting power to be represented? If you want to vote by tokens-held, then you are effectively allowing the wealthy to have greater voting power than the less wealthy. There is an argument here that the wealthy, who have invested the most in your project, deserve more voting power because they have more to lose. But new members entering your project may feel like voting is futile if they are eclipsed by others with outized voting power.\\n\\n### Don\u2019t be afraid to adapt as you scale up\\n\\nConsider what system you need right now, and be open to changing it. Regarding governance: If you are a small community with a core team, you may say that one-member-one-vote is the way to go. Do what makes sense at the time. If your project grows and you see another voting mechanism being more fruitful, go through the motions and suggest a change. Voting mechanisms are not set in stone, and shouldn\u2019t be. Your DAO needs to adapt with the changing circumstances it finds itself in.\\n\\nRegarding your discord server, Telegram or other service, consider changing it as your needs change. If your discord channels end up getting outdated, don\u2019t be afraid to archive them. If your new members are getting lost in the onboarding process, consider adapting your process to be more open to new faces. Remember that by the time you start to grow, your DAO will be something you start to understand much more easily than a new member just coming in. It\u2019s easy to lose sight of that perspective, so keep in mind to keep it simple and direct.\\n\\n### And most importantly\u2026\\n\\nHave fun! You are engaging in something new, and in a great human experiment! Issues around governance have plagued humanity for thousands of years, and now with the advent of blockchain technology we have yet another style of governance to play with. See if you can crack the code that so far no one has arguably cracked. See if you can create the perfect governance system. Good luck!\\n\\nConsidering starting a DAO?

For thousands of years civilizations have attempted to crack this pesky conundrum, and arguably we\u2019ve gotten a bit better at it. But has anyone truly solved governance? When we look at the instability in our history, it\u2019s hard to say we have.\\n\\nWith blockchain and decentralization, a new movement has emerged to try to demonstrate what proper governance can look like. The [DAO](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/daolicious-tips-for-starting-your-first-dao), or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is one of many new attempts to organize human beings in a way that is conducive to efficiently and happiness. [Tokenomics](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/the-power-of-tokenomics-explained)\u2014 a unique staple in web3 organizations\u2014 potentially hold the power to reinvent governance as we know it. So what\u2019s the best system?\\n\\n### Community as the core of great governance\\n\\nThe short answer is: we don\u2019t know. There are still total intangibles to governance that seem to elude our planning. Let\u2019s take a look at the United States\u2019 governance as an example.\\n\\nMany people will point to the United States, a representative democracy, as an example of an effective governance system. Consider, however, that early on in the forming of that government, the first president, George Washington, was given free reign to control the government as he saw fit. He could have declared himself a king, and in fact it was his completely voluntary precedents that determined much of how the government matured in subsequent years.\\n\\nMost people would agree that this kind of noble behavior is what shaped the United States toward democracy, and that Washington single-handedly could have given himself supreme power but chose not to. So this begs the question: how do we find the George Washington\u2019s in web3? Where are the builders who will willingly take a back seat to allow an organization to grow?\\n\\nAnd this is where community comes into play. A strong community with shared values and interests is one way to ensure that your members will look out for one another. George Washington has just gone through a war, and was thinking of what great sacrifices took place so that this new government could form. He was surrounded by soldiers and generals and statesmen who had gone through something similar. His incentive was to improve community, not hijack it.\\n\\nWhat does the web3 analogue look like? That\u2019s hard to say. A quick look at some of [Juicebox](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/juicebox-the-token-minting-powerhouse)\u2019s governance systems will show why we believe that are some tangibles, however, that can point you in the right direction.\\n\\n### Transparency is key\\n\\nweb3 is paradoxical in more ways than one. Perhaps at its core, however, is the idea that transparency is key. No backdoor deals, and everything can can be audited if one wishes.\\n\\nThis system dovetails with the themes of trustlessness we see all over blockchain discussions. If I\u2019m regularly doing backroom deals, in the traditional world I would need your trust to let me keep doing that. How do you know I\u2019m not abusing that trust? You don\u2019t. In the web3 world, I have to have my dealings out in the open. Now, I don\u2019t care if you trust me or not, because you can freely look at what I\u2019m doing and, if it\u2019s inappropriate, you can simple call attention to that.\\n\\nDoes this always work? No, of course not. But does it go a far way to establishing a shared value system? Yes. If everything is open, including payout distributions, proposals for how to change something, or partnership deals, then likely everyone will be on the same page about it. It also gives opportunity for structured disagreements, where hard questions can be asked.\\n\\n### Bringing it all together\\n\\nIf anybody promises you that they have a system for finding the \u201cGeorge Washingtons\u201d in your governance, run the other way. There is no sure-fire way to find the intangibles. What you can do, however, is structure your governance in a way that scares away the bad actors. Remember that your fifth columns only work when there are shadows, concealment, and graft at play. When you shine a bright light on everything, suddenly the environment is less conducive to trickery and value-misalignment (whether pernicious or well-intentioned). Keep that light shining bright, and don\u2019t be afraid to speak your mind. You owe it to yourself and to your governance-compatriots.\\n\\nWant more?

That\u2019s what the Juicebox programmable treasury delivers. It allows you to easily set payouts, determine where new funds go, how they are connected to tokens which, by the way, are also minted at your discretion. It puts all that power in your hands, without asking you to take on another full-time job, or pay out another full-time salary, saving you capital when you need it most.\\n\\n### Keeping your passion where it belongs\\n\\nThe Juicebox programmable treasury comes with a full suite of tooling that is easy to use and implement. It allows you to set your project up in a way that suits your needs. Importantly, it also allows you to keep your passion and inspiration on the thing that matters most: your project. No other web3 creation platform has the kind of functionality and fidelity of tooling that Juicebox offers, nor does any other platform have such a rich online community willing to help project creators every step of the way.

Starting a web3 business and you need to track your accounts payable/receivable? Juicebox can do that. Starting a nonprofit where you want to reward members with tokens for governance and participation? Juicebox can do that, too. Don\u2019t quite know what you want to create, but you know you want a project that executes on-chain and has more tooling than anybody else in the game? Juicebox has you covered.\\n\\nThere are few web3 platforms out there that can help you create your own project and DAO, but none of them can do it with the ease and tooling that Juicebox can. Juicebox provides users with a platform to raise money, either as a one-time or on a recurring basis, all while also offering a suit of tokenomics tooling and token minting. If you don\u2019t want tokens, no problem, you can use Juicebox like a simple programmable treasury to track donations, payments, profits (or \u201coverflow\u201d as you\u2019ll come to learn), in a transparent and honest way. The days of opaque bookkeeping where contributors have to wonder exactly how their donations are spent are over.\\n\\nJuicebox can be the backbone of a local school PTA tracking funds in and out, or it can (and has!) run multi-million dollar operations. It scales effortlessly and gives you tooling to create rich token-based voting economies, as well.\\n\\nPerhaps most unique is Juicebox\u2019s approach to what it calls \u201coverflow\u201d, which is money raised above your target amount. This money, which otherwise may be called \u201cprofit\u201d and traditionally may go to executive payrolls or reinvestment, sits in a treasury and can be claimed by any holders of your token. The proportional claim of the treasury a token holder receives is completely set by you using a variety of tooling, and it incentivizes anyone participating in your project to want to see its success. It\u2019s a great way to build a mission-aligned team and, should your project find success, it\u2019s a way to effortlessly, transparently, and efficiently reward your team members and contributors.\\n\\nWant more?

Token management is an area that every builder in the web3 space should take full advantage of; unfortunately, it\u2019s also amongst the most neglected tools by new project creators.\\n\\nAt [Juicebox](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/juicebox-the-token-minting-powerhouse), we\u2019ve created a robust and granular token management system that makes token management accessible for our project creators. We\u2019ll delve into this tooling, along with the power of tokens in general. Read on the learn more!\\n\\n## Governance and so much more\\n\\nOne crucial aspect of token minting is how they relate to governance systems within [DAOs](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/dalicious-tips-for-starting-your-first-dao)s. While you may or may not be creating a DAO, you should keep in mind that these very same governance systems can also be used informally to gauge your stakeholder interests in an effective and efficient way.\\n\\nYou can choose to give tokens at your own discretion, or set certain metrics and tokenomic tooling to automatically generate and disburse tokens based on contributions made to your project. The Juicebox difference is in the rich tooling our platform provides project creators.\\n\\n## The lifecycle of a token built on the Juicebox protocol\\n\\nHow a token is used within the Juicebox protocol varies on a number of different factors and project creator settings. Let\u2019s take a look at one particular path to help give you some insight into the lifecycle of an average token.\\n\\nYou\u2019ve created a project, and you\u2019ve set a distribution limit (how much funding your project needs in a given time frame to keep the lights on). Let\u2019s say that every two weeks your project needs to be bringing in $5,000. That amount will cover the costs of the team and any other expenses to keep your project running smoothly.\\n\\nNow let\u2019s say somebody comes along and puts $2000 into your project. In exchange for contributing those funds, they get some amount of tokens (how many is completely determined by you). Furthermore, you may want to keep some tokens every time someone contributes funds, so you set something called a *reserved rate*, which is what percentage of tokens you keep. Let\u2019s say you do 10%. So now 10% of all tokens created goes back to your project and sits in a treasury.\\n\\nNow fast forward. Many more people have contributed to your project, and at this point your distribution limit is still $5000 every two weeks, but on average you\u2019re taking in a lot more than that. All those extra funds sit in your treasury. Those \u201cextra\u201d funds are called your *overflow*.\\n\\nNow let\u2019s say one of your early investors, who has a lot of tokens for your project, wants to move on and get rid of his tokens. Rather than simply ignoring them, he can claim a percent of the overflow in your treasury proportional to how many tokens he has. If he has a lot of tokens, even though he may have initially just given you $2000 in funding, his tokens could be traded in for far more than that if your overflow is sufficiently large.\\n\\nWhat\u2019s unique about this system is that it incentivizes contributors to your project to 1) stick around, and 2) to be actively invested in your success. Some people will never be interested in trading in tokens; they may see more utility in using the tokens for governance, or simply hanging on to them as a trophy and receipt of their contributions to you. However, for those who are hoping to eventually cash out with more than they invested, the token redeeming exchange allows for this scenario if your project has become sufficiently successful.\\n\\nLet\u2019s say that first investor burns all his tokens, and gets back $3000. He\u2019s made a profit of one thousand dollars. By redeeming the tokens, he has taken them out of circulation and they have been destroyed. He\u2019s made $1000 in the exchange, and you managed to attract an investor early on when you needed funding more.\\n\\n## An overview of Juicebox tooling\\n\\nWhere Juicebox really shines is in its ability to give project creators full control over the tooling they wish to employ in their projects. There is a rich help section along with a glossary on info.juicebox.money, but for a brief overview read on to learn some of the basics.\\n\\n### Distribution Limit\\n\\nThe easiest way to think of this is by answering this question: how many funds do you need to keep the lights on for your project, and how frequently do you need them? Do you have a dev team that needs to be paid, or server hosting fees, a content writer, etc.? Whatever those costs amount to will tell you the amount of funds you need to keep your project stable and going forward.\\n\\nDo you need $2000 every two weeks? $1000 every ten days? $5000 a month? Whatever time and amount you need is what you will declare as your \u201cdistribution limit\u201d when you create a JB project.\\n\\n### Overflow\\n\\nIf your project receives more funds than you declared in your distribution limit, those extra funds will sit in a treasury. These extra funds are called overflow. Token holders can at any time redeem their tokens (trade in their tokens) for a portion of the value of overflow in your project. If your project has huge overflow because it has become very successful, then token holders can get a piece of that success by redeeming their tokens.\\n\\n### Reserve Rate\\n\\nThe reserve rate is what percentage of tokens you keep every time you mint tokens. You can set this anywhere from zero to one hundred percent or in between. Setting a reserve rate allows your project to accrue tokens. Not having a reserve rate means that all tokens you mint will go to contributors.\\n\\n### Redemption Rate\\n\\nThe redemption rate is something you set that determines how much value redeemed tokens will have based on when they are redeemed. If somebody redeems their tokens right away, they will get less proportional overflow value than someone who waits until later to redeem their tokens. A redemption rate incentivizes people to stick around as your project grows, and it disincentivizes investors who are just looking to make a quick buck. You can set an aggressive or weak redemption rate, or none at all, when you create a Juicebox project.\\n\\n### Weight\\n\\nThe term *weight* simply means how many tokens or other assets, such as NFTs, a contributor will receive for a set amount of contribution. For instance, a contributor who puts $1000 into your project may receive a million tokens (if you so choose).\\n\\n### Burning versus Redeeming tokens\\n\\nWhenever someone gives back their tokens, those tokens are destroyed permanently. If a token holder gives back tokens for a share of the overflow, we call this \u201credeeming\u201d the tokens. Let\u2019s say, however, that there is no overflow. In that case, the tokens are still traded in and destroyed, but they don\u2019t yield any value back. When this happens, we call it \u201cburning\u201d tokens.\\n\\n## Putting it all together\\n\\nThe importance of JB really sits with the excellent tooling suite you receive by using it. Regarding pricing, JB takes 2.5% of all funds raised on a project. In exchange for that you receive the JB tooling and use of the protocol which gives you a no-code solution to your web3 needs.\\n\\nWant more?

Learn about members\u2019 roles at JB and what makes them tick.*\\n\\n*If Banny had a cool mom who went on wild adventures with him across the country, it would be Sage. The resident artist who created the iconic Banny, along with a whole cornucopia of descendant-Bannies, Sage\u2019s role at JB goes way beyond branding. You can find her artistic fingerprints in the UI, in real-world designs and marketing materials, and in amazing infographs designed to streamline difficult concepts in a fun and digestible way. Read on to learn a bit about what Sage is up to nowadays and her journey to JB!*\\n\\n### Hi Sage! What\u2019re you up to right now?\\n\\nI just ate a frozen burrito. My boyfriend\u2019s sister owned a little sundry shop which just went outta business so they had groceries for free! Yesterday we went and got like 700 bucks worth of bougie groceries. I have a big thing for frozen burritos.\\n\\n### Haha. I\u2019m reminded of the story of the plumber in France. People are standing at the cathedral admiring the art and architecture, and the plumber just wants to go into the catacombs to see how they laid and routed their pipes. You can have anything, and yet the frozen burrito seems to be the winner!\\n\\nIn addition to everything else! I also like frozen chicken nuggets, which I\u2019m actually eating right now. Usually I eat pretty healthy but\u2026 when you have the option to eat gourmet chicken nuggets\u2014\\n\\n### Walk me through \u201cgourmet\u201d chicken nuggets!\\n\\nWell they\u2019re \u201corganic\u201d so yeah, whatever that means. I would never buy frozen chicken nuggets, but they were there so I figured I may as well grab them. The bougiest thing I got was, hmm\u2026  I got a free thing of 15 dollar fig pomegranate jam.\\n\\n### You know, I was once gifted a 40 dollar peanut butter jar.\\n\\nHoly shit.\\n\\n### Actually by a JB contributor\u2014 do you want to guess who?\\n\\nHmm, filipv?\\n\\n### Filipv, yes!\\n\\nHe buys 40 dollar jars of peanut butter?\\n\\n### He claims he got it as a gift\u2026 I feel kinda guilty opening it truth be told\u2026\\n\\nIn what world could a bottle of PB be worth 40 dollars?\\n\\n### Haha. I looked up the brand, it was a nice hipstery kind of homepage, lots of flowery language, but when I delved in I saw the process was exactly the same. I mean it\u2019s just mashing peanuts.\\n\\nMaybe they mash them with their feet\u2026\\n\\n### Haha, that would be hilarious. How\u2019s it going work-wise? I know you\u2019re working on a lot of designs at the moment.\\n\\nIt\u2019s been really fun, right now working on the Peri\u2019s Pringlecream ice cream Banny, and doing more fun little drawings for the Morgenstern collaboration.\\n\\n### That\u2019s awesome. How\u2019d you get started with JB, anyway?\\n\\nI started back when jango and peri were planning on calling it fountain. It was a similar analogy to JB\u2014 a fountain creates overflow. So I was doing a lot of drawings of fountains at first, not full time but juat when I had a chance. Then they decided to change the name to \u201cJuiceBox\u201d and then it started to get really fun. We were spit balling about how web3 is kind of outlawish and definitely not mainstream, so we started thinking about juice, fruit, and little punk fruit, and that turned into Banny being a weird little coding BDSM banana.\\n\\n### I always wondered about the chokers\u2026\\n\\nYeah! I guess he\u2019s also more punk in the 90s punk sense with studded everything.\\n\\n### Fascinating. If you met Banny IRL, would you guys get along?\\n\\nI think most people would get along with him, except for the squares in the world. He seems pretty chill.\\n\\n### So the punk thing is not confrontational?\\n\\nNo he\u2019s just living his authentic life.\\n\\n### What\u2019s a day in the life of Banny, in an authentic life?\\n\\nHe probably parties, gets a lot of work done, does some crazy shit\u2014 just literally anything he wants to do. He dresses weird. He may not even be a he, he could be a she, an anything, it\u2019s really just a banana.\\n\\n### He sounds like a fun banana to hang with. What\u2019s something people may be surprised to learn about you?\\n\\nHmm. I was a ballet dancer for 18 years, I did a lot of ballet and pointe work\u2014 that was fun. I\u2019m really bad at like listening/remembering dance moves and routines/sequences, so I wasn\u2019t ever super competitive but I enjoyed it a lot. I also do like to listen to music really loud and dance in my house.\\n\\n### What kind of music are you into?\\n\\nI basically solely listen to country music.\\n\\n### Favorite artist?\\n\\nSo many! If I had to pick a top three, hmm\u2026 Waylon Jennings, Garth Brook, Sturgill Simpson.\\n\\n### Awesome. What\u2019s something you\u2019re looking forward to?\\n\\nOh man, well one huge thing is that we\u2019re working on the Bannyverse and that everyone at Wagmi is killing it! Burtula is making super sick backgrounds and animations. You\u2019re writing amazing backstories for all the bannies! Tank and Natasha are building and making the site awesome! And Mieos is doing a killer job directing everything! I can\u2019t wait to launch the site and for everyone to meet and make all the hilarious bannies we\u2019ve got in store!\\n\\nAnother thing on a IRL level, maybe when gas prices go down, is that my boyfriend and I are planning to take our van out to do a tour and go see some friends in Utah and Idaho and Oregon, and do a dirtbiking trip. It\u2019ll probably go for like a month, but we have some work to do on the van first. The best thing about working for JB is that I can do these things because I work remotely."},{"id":"2022-06-14-town-hall","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/2022-06-14-town-hall","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2022-06-14 Town Hall Summary/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-14 Town Hall Summary/index.md","title":"2022-06-14 Town Hall Summary","description":"Front end updates with @aeolian and @peri","date":"2022-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"2022\u5e746\u670814\u65e5","tags":[{"label":"dao","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/dao"},{"label":"town hall","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/town-hall"},{"label":"news","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/news"}],"readingTime":9.075,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Zhape","title":"JuiceboxDAO Contributor","url":"https://twitter.com/zhape1112","imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1522548586734444544/K661H-eb_400x400.jpg","key":"zhape"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2022-06-14-town-hall","title":"2022-06-14 Town Hall Summary","authors":["zhape"],"tags":["dao","town hall","news"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Juicebox in the Words of Sage","permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-in-the-words-of-sage"},"nextItem":{"title":"Juicebox in the Words of johnnyd","permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-in-the-words-of-johnnyd"}},"content":"## Front end updates with @aeolian and @peri\\n\\n**@aeolian**: It has been a while since we gave an update, quick couple of housekeeping things on what Peel\'s up to. So for the last few funding Cycles, we\'ve been operating in two experiments, which has been really great. These align with the Juicebox funding Cycles, I\'ll drop a [link](https://github.com/orgs/jbx-protocol/projects/1/views/20) in the town hall chat for those who haven\'t seen it before. So we\'re basically scheduling issues every two weeks that is aligned with the JuiceboxDAO funding cycle. And I think what we\'re going to plan to do is to give a recap of the previous funding cycle every two weeks. So next week, we\'ll give a recap of all the stuff that was done in the last two weeks, which is going to be really really great this time around there\'s been so much done. So definitely don\'t want to miss that. \\n\\nI want to highlight one quick fun feature. That was merged yesterday. So this is the ability to add Banny stickers to Memos, which is a small thing, but potentially a fun feature which some of you have been enjoying. So thank you for everyone who worked on that particularly JohnnyD who led the implementation. Check [JohnnD\'s twitter](https://twitter.com/JohnnyD_eth/status/1536600334507843586) for a video demo of this.\\n\\nThere\'s four big things in flight at the moment. And I\'ll list them out in order of the time that they\'ll be shipped more or less. \\n\\n1. The first is giving projects the ability to relaunch on V2 and giving token holders the ability to migrate their tokens to the V2 project.\\n2. Second is V2 project handles, which is being led by Peri. Right now projects on V2 don\'t have handles like they did in V1 so that is adding support for those. \\n3. The third is NFT rewards for projects. Essentially it\'s giving projects the ability to specify like if you contribute a certain amount of funds to this project, then we will reward you with an NFT. So that\'s going to be really exciting giving projects another avenue to get funding which is great. \\n4. And then the fourth is obviously veBanny and staking.\\n\\nSo I will quicking give an overview of what\'s in store with V1 V2 migration, basically we need to give V1 projects the ability to relaunch on V2. So the canonical example is juiceboxDAO. We\'re a V1 projects. We also now have a V2 project but none of our funds are in the V2 project.\\n\\nWhat\'s gonna happen is the projects will re-launch on V2, JuiceboxDAO has already done that so we have a project on V2. They\'re then gonna move their whole balance to the V2 project. They\'re going to add another payment terminal to the V2 project, and this is a special payment terminal where it\'ll accept a V1 token and then return the V2 token in a 1:1 exchange rate.\\n\\nSo basically if I have Juicebox V1 token, there\'ll be a place in the interface to go to swap my V1 tokens for the new V2 tokens. And that\'s pretty much it. So the contracts are more or less done. Thank you to jango Dr.Gorilla and whoever else worked on that. That was really quick turnaround. And now it\'s pretty much up to the front end to get the UI done for all of what I just explained. And then we\'ll finally have upgrade path to some V1 projects to get on V2 and use all the cool new stuff. \\n\\n**@peri**: I think as everybody knows we still aren\'t supporting project handles for the new V2 projects. And this is basically just has to do with some of the changes that are made in the contracts. We used to store a handle for a project on chain and it requires a lot of extra finessing in the contracts because we had to make sure that people can use the same contract and that handles could be transferred and reserved for certain period of time and claimed, there\'s a lot of functionalities to bake in. So with the V2 project contracts, we just skipped over all that because it ended up not being very necessary for the functionality of the contracts themselves. But the downside of course is that it\'s really nice to have in the app to be able to look up projects and search for projects.\\n\\nSo we\'ve been working on another layer, another contract to add into the existing contracts that will support handles for V2 projects. It is not quite finished and it\'s not on mainnet yet.  But we do have everything kind of functionally together so I can give a demo of how it\'ll work in the app and explain how it works pretty quickly.\\n\\n![](njwILOI.png)\\n\\n_(screen sharing ongoing)_\\n\\nSo I\'ve got this empty project here on Rinkeby, ID 4117.  And we are going to set a handle for this project. \\n\\nWe\'ve got a two-transaction-process for setting a project handle. And so the way that this works is we decided to use ENS names to handle the uniqueness of project handles what I mentioned earlier for making sure that handles be passed around and exchanged. There\'s a lot of complexity there that ENS has already solved really beautifully and so we built the system around ENS names. The idea here is that if you want to use a handle for a project you will need to own the matching ENS name. So for example, I just got this ENS name on rinkby testinginprod.eth and this would allow me to set the handle of this project to testinginprod. So I\'m gonna do two steps here,\\n\\n1. I have to own this ENS name first of course,  I\'m going to set the ENS name testinginprod.eth and this would be one transaction. Once this completes, step one will be done.\\n2. The next step here is to actually set a text record on the ENS name. So if anybody\'s used the ENS name app before you\'ll know that you can come down and set these text records for any number of different things. We are using a particular key \\"Juicebox project ID\\". You can come and set this property in the ENS name app manually if you want, but that\'s a little bit of extra work. So we\'ve made it nice, pretty and clean in the app and you can basically come down here and click this button and we\'re gonna set that value in the ENS name text record to the ID of this project. So this one is 4117. So I\'m going to send this transaction, which is the same as if I just came over here and just manually put 4117 here. That\'ll show up here if you got the handle set up.\\n\\nMost importantly that\'ll allow your project to be searched on the projects page. Right now the search bar works by searching for project handles and V2 projects don\'t have handles you can\'t search for them. It\'s very lame that is now a thing of the past as soon as you set a handle for your project. Your project will be searchable. \\n\\nAn important thing to note is that either of these things change, for example if you were to transfer the ENS name and someone else changes that text record, your handle will go back to empty. So you have to have both of these things set constantly or if you were to change this to some other ENS name, your handle would go back to empty.\\n\\nAnother fun fact is you can also actually do subdomains here. \\n\\nWe will hopefully have that on mainnet this week. I\'m pretty sure we\'re doing. some just some last-minute things, but mostly everything is good to go. So expect it pretty soon. \\n\\n**@0xSTVG:** So does that mean that I could create multiple projects with subdomains of my ENS?\\n\\n**@peri**: You could. But you can\'t have multiple projects using the same ENS name. So if you had like STVG.eth, and you want to do like one project one.STVG.eth and the other project two.STVG.eth, those could be two separate handles for different projects.\\n\\n@mieos: Once we get that up and running, I think a screen recording of you going through that or WAGMI can put together a little infographic on what it is and how it works, especially when it gets up to the subdomain part, it\'s just technical enough. \\n\\n\\n## veBanny by @Jmill\\n\\nI want to show a map with the veBanny stuff. I\'ve been doing some work on the subgraph implementation to index the user tokens and interact with them. Right now we had a couple of big steps forward. One thing is there\'s now a metadata file to parse for all the the characters or the variants so you can go through and scroll through the characters and figure out which one you want and then you can see them all in here, too. So that\'s been a nice upgrade because you can pull that all from one place now.\\n\\n_(screen sharing ongoing)_\\n\\nSo these are NFT positions that I\'ve taken on this account. So you like lock positions that are actually coming from on chain. And then you can interact with them also, so I can do that to extend the lock or I can unlock the ones that have finished. So I can take this one and extend the lock like a thousand days. Then it takes a minute for the graph to re-index it, but it\'ll show up 30 seconds later with the new lockdate.\\n\\nAnd then other than that I showed this last week, we have a new contract where you can mint for one second just like test the unlock and redeem stuff. But yeah, I showed this on the last demo where you can  also like take a staking position and actually mint these things through the front end works also. \\n\\n## quizz time:\\n\\n![](AME442G.png)\\n\\nThe answer is....\\n\\n**Nicholas**\\n\\n- As a student I made jewelry and garment. \\n- I was a nationally ranked debater.\\n- I haven\'t been Malta before.\\n\\n\\n\\n## NFT update by @JohnnyD\\n\\n**@JohnnyD**: I\'ll just add a few sentences to what @aeolian has summarized before. We\'re gonna be automatically rewarding contributors NFTs when they contribute above a certain amount. and then the next step will be adding a restriction around, such as time restrictions so ensuring that those NFTs are distributed only before a certain funding cycle. But for now, we\'re just going with the amounts. \\n\\n## Announcement from @briley\\n\\n**@briley**: Yeah, thanks. I was just gonna make a small announcement that Matthew and I are recording podcast episode with lexicon Devils on Thursday if you have any questions that you would like to ask you can let us know. Otherwise, we\'ll be doing that in advance of the JB MorganStern\'s voxel slash IRL event."},{"id":"juicebox-in-the-words-of-johnnyd","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-in-the-words-of-johnnyd","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2022-06-07-juicebox-in-the-words-of-johnnyd.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-07-juicebox-in-the-words-of-johnnyd.md","title":"Juicebox in the Words of johnnyd","description":"\u201cJuicebox in the words of\u201d is a series that highlights JB community members in interview form.

Learn about members\u2019 roles at JB and what makes them tick.*\\n\\n*JohnnyD is a front-end dev and a core member of the Peel Team. His work is plainly visible on our website, where he takes an active role both in the front-end code and, increasingly, in the design elements of the website. How visual architecture complements site tooling and functionality are an area of great interest and focus for him. Recently, he\u2019s been on the road with Zeugh at a couple of conferences, and by the time I caught up to him was traveling solo across Europe. Read on to learn a bit about his origin story, interests and future aspirations!*\\n\\n### Greetings! I know you\u2019re in the midst of traveling, thank you for taking the time. How\u2019s it been going?\\n\\nHey! It\u2019s been really good. Some good wins, we think, and some good projects to follow up on. We learned a lot about how to communicate our value proposition and got a lot of good stuff.\\n\\n### So important. Here\u2019s the million dollar question: what have you found is the ideal way to communicate JB\u2019s value proposition?\\n\\nIt really depends a lot on the projects. I think it\u2019s really important to fish out what a project wants and what needs we\u2019re there to give them. From there we\u2019ll know what JB features that\u2019ll help them the most\u2014 whether that be transparency in earning/spending, or the ease of launching an ERC-20 token and having that distributed to people upon contributing. Or whether automating payments out of the treasury and restricting/reconfigurations of that spending are the way they want to go. Those are the key points\\n\\n### It strikes me a scalability problem. We seem to have a boutique approach at the moment, almost like a concierge service. As we expand, how do we streamline some of that onboarding without losing that conversation with the user?\\n\\nYou\u2019ve hit the nail on the head, that\u2019s absolutely what we have to focus on. I definitely have ideas around that; mainly I really like the idea of categorizing particular common projects/project types, like NFC Coops, straight up Web3 businesses, or the classic one-time fundraiser. I think having clear resources for these like links to pre-filled templates could be super helpful and useful. Essentially, we want people to come to the site and feel comfortable setting up a project themselves without having someone walking them through it.\\n\\n### For sure. Out of curiosity, what was it like gallivanting around with Zeugh?\\n\\nHe\u2019s a great guy! Super fun, super smart, super easy going, super hard worker. Oh man\u2026 constant networking! He can just keep getting the word out, rubbing elbows. He\u2019s got unlimited energy\u2014 a total machine!\\n\\n### It\u2019s funny, arguably the most powerful JB tool, the treasury, seems like a little on the backburner for most people. It seems like they don\u2019t quite see the scope of its use. What do you make of that?\\n\\nYeah exactly, there are so few projects using these treasury tools. I think it should be a big priority of ours to present it in a more understandable way; I\u2019m keen to make it more visible on the front-end too. As great and flexible as the protocol is, it can be a tall order for people to understand.\\n\\n### Okay, now on to your origin story. How\u2019d you get started with JB and how has it changed since you\u2019ve been here?\\n\\nI was working as a front-end dev for a few years in web2, actually, doing React and some other stuff. Before JB a group of friends and I started getting into NFTs and we wanted to create a DAO to be an NFT Coop, with the goal being to acquire some of the more expensive NFTs. Aeolian was one of my buddies in that NFT and he found JB and looked at the github, started working a bit on it, and told me about it. After a week or so I started doing the same. It was so exciting, I pretty much quit my job 2 weeks later and said okay, I\u2019m doing this.\\n\\n### Front-end seems like so cross-disciplinary. You\u2019re juggling user-interface/design along with coding. What\u2019s that like?\\n\\nI really love designing! Before JB it wasn\u2019t a big part of my job at all. I would just get the designs and make it exactly as I was told. At JB I\u2019ve enjoyed the challenge of just putting yourself in the user\u2019s shoes and making it as smooth and seamless as possible.\\n\\n### That\u2019s the beauty of web3, isn\u2019t it? If you want to take something on, and you are capable, nobody seems to care whether you have formal training, degrees, etc.\\n\\nFor sure, it\u2019s an absolutely beautiful part of web3. I would say it\u2019s even more like that in the software industry than in most other industries. Web3 has taken that to a whole other level. It\u2019s totally about what you can produce right now, not what you did a while back, or what you\u2019re promising you\u2019ll do in the future.\\n\\n### Speaking of the future\u2014 what\u2019s the future look like for johnnyD?\\n\\nFront-end! I really like the front-end work process, and I\u2019m becoming more inclined towards the design if anything, which is interesting. As much as I love development, really feel a passion for design building more and more. So yeah, we\u2019ll see where that takes me.\\n\\n### Awesome. Okay, let\u2019s get down to brass tacks. Who\u2019s your favorite JB member, and why is it Sage?\\n\\nHaha, oh man. Sage does some incredible art\u2014 that stuff is really inspiring. I remember coming to JB and just loving the vibes so much, there was just something so original about it. Sage created those vibes in Banny, like a character who sets the tone for us. That\u2019s why Sage is my favorite.\\n\\n### Can you see a future with Banny in the Louvre? Tourists lining up just to get a few minutes with an original, NFT Banny displayed on an LCD screen?\\n\\nHaha. I think we could see Banny anywhere and everywhere.\\n\\n### Cheers to that! Okay, I heard you\u2019re into music, and that you even play. What are you into?\\n\\nI actually played trumpet quite a lot in high school. Like I was really into it. I also played the piano a little bit.\\n\\n### Another trumpeter! You know filipv plays a mean trumpet, right?\\n\\nOh man, no I didn\u2019t know that. I gotta connect with him, that\u2019s so awesome!\\n\\n### I\u2019ve been thinking, we have so many musicians at JB. What if we create like a little folder where we record samples, little licks and riffs. If anybody\u2019s in sound production they could come and take those and fashion them into something.\\n\\nHaha, yeah I love it. If someone sends me sheet music and a tempo I\u2019m down!\\n\\n### I\u2019ll look into it, it would be awesome. Okay, last question: what\u2019s something that people would be surprised to learn about you?\\n\\nHmm. I\u2019m quite into triathlons, so much so that before JB I was actually trying to make a career out of it. I\u2019m still pretty into it, actually.\\n\\n### Bear with me here\u2014 that\u2019s running, bicycling and swimming right?\\n\\nThat\u2019s correct, but in exactly the reverse order though!\\n\\n### Got it. Can you give me a sense of the appeal, versus just cycling/running/swimming on its own?\\n\\nI\u2019ve always loved doing multiple sports, and there\u2019s just nothing more challenging in my opinion than training for three disciplines. Then the events themselves are also extremely challenging. I love the lifestyle of being well-rounded as opposed to just hammering away at one thing, and I think triathlons with a bit of gym work is probably the healthiest activity there is. Can\u2019t get enough of it.\\n\\n### Fair enough, it definitely sounds challenging! So where are you off to next on your travels?\\n\\nI\u2019m actually heading into Lviv right now, I\u2019m on a bus to get there. I plan to stay about three weeks. I\u2019ve met so many Ukrainians so far on my trip, and they all tell me Lviv is just the best city in Europe. I\u2019m keen to see it for myself.\\n\\n### Do you anticipate any issues with the crisis happening?\\n\\nLviv is more or less untouched from war, from what I\u2019m told. What I keep hearing is, \u201cThe city hasn\u2019t changed, but the people have.\u201d So I\u2019m curious to see how it is.\\n\\n### I\u2019m sure that will be quite an experience. Keep us posted when you return, and until then safe travels!\\n\\nThank you!"},{"id":"2022-06-07-town-hall","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/2022-06-07-town-hall","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2022-06-07-town-hall-summary/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-07-town-hall-summary/index.md","title":"JuiceboxDAO Town Hall June 07, 2022","description":"Warning of Influx of new members.","date":"2022-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"2022\u5e746\u67087\u65e5","tags":[{"label":"dao","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/dao"},{"label":"town hall","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/town-hall"},{"label":"news","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/news"}],"readingTime":20.91,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Zhape","title":"JuiceboxDAO Contributor","url":"https://twitter.com/zhape1112","imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1522548586734444544/K661H-eb_400x400.jpg","key":"zhape"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2022-06-07-town-hall","title":"JuiceboxDAO Town Hall June 07, 2022","authors":["zhape"],"tags":["dao","town hall","news"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Juicebox in the Words of johnnyd","permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-in-the-words-of-johnnyd"},"nextItem":{"title":"Juicebox in the Words of Mieos","permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-in-the-words-of-mieos"}},"content":"## Warning of Influx of new members.\\n\\n**filipv**: On June 7^th^, the Discord server of JuiceboxDAO was faced with a big influx of new members from Indonesia. According to @Zeugh, they came from several big Telegram chat groups that are mainly focused on airdrops. There might be a misintrepretation that if they create a project on rinkeby.juicebox.money and give feedback in the Discord server, they will be entitiled to some kind of Juicebox airdrop. **We don\'t have any airdrop currently.**\\n\\n**Zeugh**\uff1a I think it won\'t do any substantial harm to JuiceboxDAO, and think it a great opportunity to showcase the functionalities of our protocol to these people, and to onboard some new members who are really interested in our products.\\n\\n## veBanny Front End updates by @Jmill\\n\\n**Jmill**: I have been working pretty extensively on the veBanny front end, trying to get it out the door. Now that the contracts are deployed, we can work to transactions and use real data.\\n\\n(_sharing screen and demonstrating the process of staking tokens for an Locked NFT_)\\n\\nSo we\'re now minting this thing through the website which is cool. The stuff is all working now, and show up pretty cool.\\n\\n**jango**: I\'ve also been on the contract side of things that @Viraz has been doing a great job, asking for reviews over the tests. The tests he\'s writing and adding more fuzzing tests to the suite. So hopefully at this point, it\'s throwing a lot of use cases at the cocept. And i suppose it\'ll make way on to the actual final details to complete the workflow.\\n\\n**Jmill**: The big thing next is to read the onchain data and get the use of NFT, and then allow them to extend their locked positions on a particular NFT. All of those are related to fetching data, about multiple tokens. We\'re talking about this in Peel\'s Discord, and right now it\'s implemented as ERC-721 Enumerable, but it\'ll probably be easier if it were structured similiar with Juicebox projects where you have a directory structure and subgraph, to look that information up without recursive calls to open by index. So that\'s probably what we need to start thinking about how we index these information for the purpose of front end to grab it and work with the data. \\n\\n**jango**: Yeah, that makes sense. Also from a juiceboxDAO or Juicebox perspective in Juicebox.money, we\'ll possibly first have to deploy their staking contract and specify the lock duration they want etc. It isn\'t going to be there for everyone first, they have to specify those things, so that that initial transaction to deploy a staking contract will go through a contract that somewhat serve as a directory or at least it\'ll file an event that\'s indexable to service a directory. If Peel and Juicebox.money feel it a decent thing to offer all projects over time and they should be able to interact with that same depolyer contract to get their own version of this.\\n\\n**filipv**:What\'s the timeline looking like? Is that somehting we can expect deploying in the next month?\\n\\n**jango**: We need V1 > V2 migration to do it for JuiceboxDAO. We can deploy this for an arbitrary project though. We can launch a new project and just has it work there, so you can start minting stuff, just as normal treasury and lock it there, at which point there\'s not much difference between test and rinkeby as we currently are. But to get the JuiceboxDAO version of this and the Bannyverse version at least from a ecosystem perspective, we need to get V1 > V2 migration, and then there might be other technical things along the way.\\n\\n**Jmill**: From a front end perspective, there are a couple of things that would be helpful so that there\'s some kind of indexing data you can easily pull user\'s NFT statistics. That\'s a more simple and scalable way to do with subgraph query. It would be really usefull if the ve NFT contract deployer also deploy a single consolidated metadata file. Let\'s say veBanny has 60 characters and they all have a name and staking ranges, it\'ll be really nice that the contract generate that as one file that front end could grab and parse to display without going to 60 metadata files individually. That would be a quality-of-life thing from the contract side for the front end.\\n\\n**tankbottoms**: We could add another function for that metadata, basically something that will conform with an NFT but also has pointers to all assets you need, because you can pick them through the JSONs however you want.\\n\\n**Jmill**: The last item I have here is that we\'re implementing beneficiary for this, so that users can stake and put someone else as the beneficiary.\\n\\n**jango**: That\'ll be useful for even a DAO to lock its supply, and designate other contributor or some other beneficiary for. It\'s cool to have flexibility. The core thing being built allows everyone on the peripheral of the project to start to wrap their heads around what situation it\'s gonna be when this thing is out there.\\n\\n## Product prospective with @Zeugh\\n\\n![](ktQrGSS.png)\\n\\n**Zeugh**: The Juicebox.money is a complex thing to use. I think it will be something to see that front end are more focused on some type of projects. Let\'s say there\'s a NFT project wants to launch its treasury on Juicebox, they can have a direct way for easy launch to help set it up ahead of time. You want to launch a NFT project and make the funds through Juicebox so people can co-own the treasury like tileDAO did and issue tokens for people that are minting.\\n\\nThose are some of the configurations that we think we should do. That could be something like Juicebox.nft instead of Juicebox.money. And if you want to go to the hard mode and be able to configure every single thing, that\'s still running on the same protocol.\\n\\nThat\'s what I call the product prospective. We have a very good protocol perspective here that is building something really robust and can do lots of things. In the end looking at product level, maybe not all the users will need all of these things and having an easy way to launch might be something interesting.\\n\\n**jango**: I think there\'s a lot of to keep improving the onboarding stuff and especially we just came out of V2 trying to start with parity where V1 was. The name of the game now is just constant improving based on our own interest with onboarding as well as pulling together other people\'s perspective. It\'s hard to be certain that it\'s one thing or another thing from my point of view, but without question we\'re going to hinge towards better alternatives to prototypes that are massively useful. Shout out to JohnnyD and Aeolian and all the people in Peel who are eager and quick to make prototypes and start discord threads so that we can discuss the improvements. And then match this with a occasional AHA moment that a few different ideas come together that make sense to a lot of folks and somehow we unlock a lot more fluidity to the onboarding process. \\n\\nI\'m certainly with you that we have a lot of work to do with explaining what people are getting into, like starting with giving everyone all the information upfront and make all risks as clear as possible. Overtime we can start to reel back into some managable shortcuts. \\n\\nI think now we\'re definitely buckling for more long term investments both from a building perspective and the relationship perspective with other communities. I\'m eager to see how that project chart changes over time. I think from my personal perspective and talking to projects, the recent lows haven\'t been very encouraging for projects to launch. But now that V2 is out, we\'re going to see a lot more of that.\\n\\n**nicholas**: When I did onboarding with Austin from BuildGuild and he had some feedback about simplifying. It\'s a little bit difficult for someone on the outside to know exactly which simplifying approach will be successfull on the market aside from just iterating on simplifying the existing one. But I do have some suspicion that there are a larger category of people who are not so inclined to use Juicebox in its current form but might be inclined to do so for this example we\'re talking couple of times about NFT collections, splitting off a portion of their primary and/or secondary to Juicebox and letting the holders manage it, which doodles, cryptopunks and a bunch of other projects already do. That\'s a category I\'m super interested in getting on the creation flow for that. It could be just like presets on what we\'ve already got, or maybe an entirely separate creation flow where you can imagine entirely different front ends that just make creation really tight for a specific use case and then you can go use Juicebox.money\'s full advanced front end and subsequently managing those things but make it easier for people to get onboard. It could be pretty integrated at Juicebox.money. There\'s a lot to explore.\\n\\n**filipv**: One thng that we\'ve discussed that might be interesting would be if there\'s a way to easily import and export project configurations which Austin Griffith originally brought up, for exporting a project that was made on testnet to mainnet. That might be cool because you can use that feature to set up templates that have base project configurations.\\n\\nAnother thing I want to talk about is what we\'re discussing a lot in the chat about amount of metrics. I\'m not sure how useful focusing on any specific North Star metric would be. It\'s very hard to encapsulate everything in Juicebox, and I think everything is conflating with each other. So I think we can take anything and roll with it, but I don\'t know if it\'s worthy going super deep into which is the best North Star metric.\\n\\n**Aeolian**: I\'m totally with @filipv. I think the goal I originally had with proposing this metric was not so much like \\"ok! Let\'s review this number every week!\\" or \\"Oh! it\'s going down, what\'s happening?\\" It\'s more like what we\'re all in some sense collectively optimizing for everything from a product, website, documentation and content strategy, the whole thing. Our goal right now is to increase the number of active projects. I agree with you that at this stage where traffic is still very low, really trying to hatch out a metric that\'s instructive right now. It\'s more to get us all on the same page.\\n\\n**jango**: I think the general consensus is that it feels good to have activity. I guess you could put on a chart and optimize for it, but personally I want to think about metrics that make me lean in more in moment\'s notice seeing activities, and seeing folks I know engaging with other projects making me want to learn more about them.\\n\\n## Govenance discussion\\n\\n**@filipv**: I want to open up some discussion on the recent governance cycle, both in itself and some of the proposals. \\n\\nOne thing I want to bring up first is the possibility of changing the governance cycle in order to allow for longer temperature checks because I definitely feel the temp check are too short. But there\'s also balance if you lengthen the temp check, it makes it harder to get things through the governance process and it takes longer to get things done. We did a poll and people are really into the weekday idea.\\n\\n![](nG8Bn2D.png)\\n\\n**nicholas**: Since people prefer temp check ends during the week, I\'d particularly like the proposal edit freeze to happen during the week, because I had to spend a lot of Sundays modifying proposals because people obviously just give comments leading up to the freeze and I prefer it end in the week. I understand people have jobs and I am certain that might not be convenient, but people from the poll seem to be happy with that idea.\\n\\n**jango**: For me personally, it\'s nice to end on weekend because I can do a lot more meeting oriented and dev oriented stuff during the week, and in the weekend, I can read the proposals and think about those. There\'s not much weekend breaktime.\\n\\n**nicholas**: How specified should proposals be? I made a suggestion that is three points if you add them to the proposals, \\n![](GbRQJsd.png)\\nmaybe they will enable more delegation, because a lot of the burden getting the proposal through can be like knowing exactly what steps should be taken, when it\'s not always necessary DAO knows every single steps if DAO is willing to accept the risks, the implementation risk of someone delegating it to the person who\'s the author or someone specified in the proposal. I think it\'s a decent choice if it\'s a better financial allocation and also adding a risk in risk section which is like \\"Look, we\'re not specifying the address the money got set to, we don\'t think that\'s a super important detail for the DAO to be voting on\\", but that\'s a risk we can screw up sending it to a wrong address because it wasn\'t specified in the proposal. It allow the proposal to move forward before all those details are sorted out. Some proposal do deserve to have hyper detailed specifications and it\'s important for the DAO to vote on it, others delegation will be more appropriate. I think that might be a interesting format for making governance more manageable. \\n\\n**filipv**: I\'m definitely onboard with that. I think that thing need to be weighted very carefully just because it\'s not like we are going through a hierachy and people are revising it in every step. It\'s kind of like every proposal goest to the multisig like the one source of truth. It\'s like something running close to the middel very powerful and very dangerous. I think we need to be careful about specifications and and we don\'t want to lead to some DAO crisis when people are disagreeing on an interpretation of the proposal after the fact.\\n\\nFirst of all it waste a bunch of time, also people are gonna get upset and may lead to conflicts. So I am generally more of a stickler that we should have very specific proposals just because how dangerous it is. I wonder if there is a way to incentivize people to submit a bunch of proposals earlier so they can be spread out ever a greater period of time. We really see most proposal submitted close to the end of temp check. It\'s not an easy question to solve.\\n\\n**nicholas**: Part of the challenge is the 14days cycle, if you would like to submit a proposal for something and temp check submission just opened, that means you  can no longer submit a proposal and you could be waiting for 20+ days till the next opportunity to vote. It may be worthwhile, for instance the bug bounty, I can see both sides on it, maybe a longer process allow us to consider, but at the same time, the protocol needs the bounty pretty badly. \\n\\nI think it would be of some value not entirely in the direction of everything being specified because the reality is that just making through all of that governance and having opinions on it is stretching the limits of the bandwidth of even the most dedicated members of the DAO. It also becomes less decentralized the more because people are just voting along with other people who have already voted. There\'s also some needs to us to recognize that actually the DAO doesn\'t need to vote on every single details of everything, and some amount of delegation is probably gonna be necessary over the medium term. \\n\\n**filipv**: Two thoughts on that.\\n\\nOne is that I don\'t see why we couldn\'t do it right now like approving a budget in advance to reduce future governance overhead and go through that process. I think that\'s very achievable and I\'m interested in pursuing that.\\n\\nSecond thought is that jango has be mentioning lately the idea of possibly pursuing funding for projects and budgets for projects rather that fuding budgets for individuals or groups, which I think compelling because the structure of what we are doing shifts a lot and it\'s the post V2 transitory period. So I wonder maybe a shift towards budgeting for things get done rather than having all these smaller individual small group proposals may accomplish what you are talking about being able to improve things in advance and delegates to someone who\'s leading the project.\\n\\n**jango**: Some of the treasury allocations have also been tricky in the past weeks because we\'ve been tuning the treasury create stuff on and off while we address some protocol problem. Those should be made well in advance in proposals being specified to be directed towards them. I am definitely in the camp of more hyper specificity upfront and throughout the temp check process.\\n\\n**filipv**: Would you want to work with Juicebox if you didn\'t get funding through an individual basis, but rather as a part of multiple projects?\\n\\n**jango**: The end of payment routing is still individual payout, either from a project that you control like what JohnnyD has, or through a direct payment from a project. The idea is that it\'s just not managed by a conglomerate governance system.\\n\\n**felixander**: I want to talk with JohnnyD and Aeolian about this. What happens when you bring a human on for a projects and the project is solved? It doesn\'t make sense for the system now because we\'ve committed a budget to something that only took 2-3 months, but now somebody is there, but they\'re taking on another work that might be totally separating them from what they\'re doing. I think it\'s something a little bit messy in terms of how the payment structure works presently.\\n\\n**jango**: I feel that kind of work is really important when a project is starting out, that\'s still the case now and will likely still be months into the future. There\'s a lot happening and everyone is contributing to whatever the next person needs. So people are just shouting \\"hey I got this dope thing in progress, it\'d be sweet if I could have this ounce of help\\" and luckily there\'s a lot of people around who are eager and feeling supportive to do that work. So the individual payouts feel appropriate in that world.\\n\\nI think that would set the expectation that there\'s a lot of stuff that we\'ve building isn\'t just onging forever, we\'re not hired by JuiceboxDAO to be here comfortably and feel valued imbued and viewed by our relationship to one another and to the concept of the projects. Once those projects play themselves out, I think it\'s healthy to reassess what our purpose is amongst current state of the projects and how we can prepare ourselves for future state of uncertainty which are always upon us. That\'s the thing we can almost guarantee. \\n\\n**felixander**: Would that be the same way like Peel, WAGMI and Canu, the idea that people would branch off like Peel now is under a budget to do front end? You could imagine people who are doing docs would branch out and have a budget, and people who are doing translation would also branch off and have a budget.\\n\\n**jango**: I think that\'s in a creative part and I\'m sure everyone will bring their own taste of how to frame these things. It\'s effective to pay Peel to work on the Juicebox.money project, front end developers can assess each other\'s contributions and payouts better than any multidisciplinary group would.\\n\\nThese things will inevitably shift and change over time, as people come and go, as well as the projects changing. It\'s tougher for the community to rationalize consistent budgeting for an abtract group of people with an abtract but pointed mission, the individuals are liquid between all these project organizaitons and we hve to respect that. People are going to find their leverage over time and they don\'t owe anything to any organizations. We\'re all just building ourselves out and learning from each other in  this whole process. I think we\'re going to see a lot of different ways to organize it.\\n\\nShout out to Zom_Bae creating the Juicebox events version for the upcoming ice cream event and it\'s in a potential to add more longevity to that concept. What if we\'re to actually trying to fund events consistently and have a pool of resources that we can make this up every single time. We can just re-reference something that we know to be true already.\\n\\nI think we\'re on the same page eventually. We\'ve got to create the right incentive model to shift away from building up the Juicebox foundation to supporting one in any numbers of projects and then servie it to the world and make it the gateway. But as the protocol tends towards stability, it\'ll be great to have tighter articulation of what it means for a project to succeed over time.\\n\\n**Aeolian**: I do like what @casstoshi brought up about the idea of each group having a budget and individual contributors are paid from that budget. I think Peel has done this. At a time all the front end people were doing individual proposals to JuiceboxDAO and the sentiment was that it\'s hard to evaluate these proposals. So intead JuiceboxDAO votes on a single budget for front end and that team can handle that budget as they see fit.\\n\\nI\'ll post a [link](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp68-modify-protocol-engineering-core-unit-budget-pe-001/13797) that Drgorilla posted earlier about how makerDAO manages this process where there\'s a clear budget for each abstract collecton of people. It definitely breaks down as we\'ve seen with some proposals over the last couple of weeks. It\'s hard to pinpoint someone into one of those particular groups, people can work ver much across thses groups.\\n\\nI still think it\'s instrutive not only from accounting perspective but also from an organizational perspective, it just makes it easy to reason about someone\'s payout if they\'re clearly contributing to a specific area.\\n\\n## Project highlights\\n\\n**gogo**: I\'m very glad to be able to discover the future of ComicsDAO and strategy of what we\'re gonna do there. We had a super contribution from JuiceboxDAO from the beginning which is pretty amazing. \\n\\nI would like to share what we just thought. So we basically are doing a full story and the beginning starts with [this post here](https://twitter.com/ComicsDAO/status/1533991837865746432). \\n![](5MGlSvX.png) \\nWhat I would like to propose is that this is our heroes Banny and they\'re travelling throught the DAO galaxy to DAOs. We would like to know where JuiceboxDAO would like the ship to go to the next DAO, so that we can keep on building covers to next DAO. Let\'s create a poll here and vote on the DAO that JuiceboxDAO decides what ComicsDAO is gonna do next. \\n\\nAnother thing is that, we had a big player, this guy is amazing and helps us a lot.\\n![](IY9Sqof.jpeg)\\n\\nWe are having fun creating next cover for other DAO, and we are going to make some jokes for JokeDAO and get partnership to work with them. \\n\\n**jango**: That\'s the coolest part of ComicsDAO. I love the treasury management, a part of which is to buy rare comics and hold thme, but the day to day potential of being the storytelling branch of differnt DAOs, which is immensely powerful. And so far you are all playing really well, well done.\\n\\n**nicholas**: There\'re a bunch of really cool projects this week. JokeDAO just launched a super sick governance experimentation project. \\n\\nAustin Griffith\'s BuildGuild got launched this week and there\'s a proposal to fund a hackathon for them to transform scaffold-eth into something compatible with Juicebox or to build the hackathon projects using scaffold-eth with juicebox involved in the picture. And as jango mentioned in  his twitter that Juicebox front end is based on scaffold-eth. \\n\\nSo it\'s very cool to see comfort circle, and hopefully we will be able to fund a modest hackathon to get the treasury kickstarted with funds, hopefully getting that brew of hackers into the ecosystem. \\n\\n@twodam\'s has posted a twitter about this week\'s projects [here](https://twitter.com/twodam_eth/status/1534200052511518720).\\n![](zGAeIDq.png)\\n\\n**jango**: Super exciting. Thank you @nicholas for doing a lot. Most excited once we get the V1 V2 token stuff, situated to start talking to the SharkDAO, or a lot of folks operating on V1 still doing ongoing work and fundraising, to see if they want to move over and leverage some of the new tools to make their projects more successful, whatever that means to them these days.

Learn about members\u2019 roles at JB and what makes them tick.*\\n\\n*Big Daddy Mieos is the patriarch of Wagmi studios and a certified JB OG. He\u2019s seen Juicebox evolve from it\u2019s very beginnings to the robust platform it is today, and he launched one of its very first projects back in the day. Meios is a gentle conductor of creative JB branding and a level-headed voice of reason within the JB community. Read on to learn a bit more about this awesome JB contributor, what he\u2019s up to right now, and the origin story of Wagmi Studios.*\\n\\n### Hey Mieos! What\u2019re you up to right now and what\u2019s on your mind?\\n\\nHmm\u2026 the thing that has been occupying my attention and creativity a lot lately has been this desire to convert the greater portion of juicebox projects from these crowd-funded single-purchase projects to something more like a product or service or longer-term projects that build out and make full use of JB tooling.\\n\\nIt\u2019s really also about trying to find a way for creators to run creative endeavors on web3 because they believe web3 is where we\u2019re going, but may not be super comfortable with web3 yet. I feel like I\u2019m really hunting down people who I know may be able to bridge this gap and show some excellent JB use cases.\\n\\n### I think DAOs are still new enough where the people themselves have to be the tools, almost like fleshy UIs that can help navigate doers who may not be fluent or even conversational in the web3 world. Definitely not an easy person to find.\\n\\nNo, haha, definitely not! We\u2019re stuck in a beautiful moment where V2 is starting to open up an opportunity for non full-web3 nerds, whereas with V1 there really wasn\u2019t much chance for non web3-nerds. V2 is starting to change that and I think that will lead to more great things.\\n\\n### How does Wagmi fit into all this?\\n\\nI think Wagmi has to take a position of palatable education. I think good branding does that. It points people in the right direction for the kind of info they want. I\u2019ve always wanted Wagmi to be more educational, but when we started to do this with V1, V2 was on the horizon so we held off. After all with all the changes coming with V2 it didn\u2019t make sense to produce a lot of content that would all just have to be redone a few months later. Now that V2 is here and coming into its own, we can really go full force into this endeavor.\\n\\n### For what it\u2019s worth, when I started, as a total JB n00b, the Wagmi videos were really the easiest entryway to me.\\n\\nYeah and that\u2019s what it\u2019s about. We want creatives, people who may be a bit unclear on web3, but who see where its going and recognize its value. And those people will bring their supporters over. Making great content to help ease that transition into web3 is a biggie to attract those people.\\n\\nIn terms of Wagmi\u2019s future, I\u2019d ultimately love to see Wagmi move away from full-time JB stuff and move more toward helping projects on the platform succeed. We could give these projects a little shove in the creative department, whether by helping them with animations, designing mascots, and who knows what else.\\n\\n### I\u2019ve felt like JB High could be a central point of info for newbies. Obviously a lot of that exists already elsewhere on the web, but do you see any value in really doing like a \u201cweb3 crash course\u201d on JB High to truly onboard a total n00b from starting to finishing their first project creation?\\n\\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s overkill to do that at all, we just have to be clear on our time cost, and we shouldn\u2019t invest too much time if there are more efficient ways to do it. I think a web3 crash course could be done in 2-3 animated shorts plus maybe a page or two on JB High; it\u2019s not a heavy lift.\\n\\n### How\u2019d you get started with JB, and how has it changed since you\u2019ve been there?\\n\\nFrom the very beginning, I was trying to figure out from what JB could be. Jango\u2019s take was that JB was a payment terminal, so I was like okay, are we building Stripe for web3? But then he was talking about treasuries, and discount rates and bonding curves, and pre-minting tokens and reserve rates, and I was like man, nobody\u2019s gonna have any idea what this is. When I finally grokked it I was like \u201cOhhhh, this is what this could be!\u201d\\n\\nI saw some possible use cases, and was talking to some of the early guys about what it could do, but I think none of us really grasped it. It was so new and there just wasn\u2019t really a concept you could build off, you really had to understand it for what it was, as something unique, and that took time.\\n\\nBut before even all that happened, I was working with Sage to figure out the brand and how we can we make this whole JB thing feel cool, and actually one of the first things we messed with was claymation.\\n\\n### I saw a claymation video floating around! Is that one of those early things?\\n\\nYeah, that\u2019s one of the first things Wagmi ever did! It was a lot of fun.\\n\\nAnother biggie early on, actually probably the first thing that came up as important, was starting to think was how could we help people understand what JB could do. So I figured \u201cOh, I could launch a project on JB and that could serve as an example for people of what to do.\u201d\\n\\nSo I told Sage, hey, let\u2019s run something like an animated studio/illustration studio out of JB, really as an example of JB\u2019s power, and that was the birth of Wagmi. And it has been an absolutely great example. I\u2019m really glad we did that rather than stay as paid contributors in JB itself. It serves as a great example for how projects can coexist in the space and serve one another.\\n\\n### Was JB your first jump into web3?\\n\\nYeah, it was! I\u2019ve just always been interested in tech projects and when I got to know jango and peri and they were talking about tech projects I just wanted to hang out and learn, and to try to help in any way I could.\\n\\n### Man, that\u2019s such a high bar for a n00b to get into.\\n\\nHaha, yeah it was a high bar, I still remember it took me 4 months! I spent 4 months saying the words and having no idea what I was talking about\u2014 \u201cYeah yeah yeah, the payment terminal, and getting ETH out and bonding curve, and the redemption rate,\u201d I had no idea what I was talking about, and then, finally one day it clicked! It was so rewarding, and it validated to me so much of what I had been trying to grasp.\\n\\n### I ran into that in a very dense philosophy text once that was like that. So hard to grasp, you wanna walk away, since you definitely don\u2019t wanna stick around and feel stupid. That\u2019s a tough spot to be in.\\n\\nYeah! Sticking around and feeling stupid sucks. You want to help, you want to chip in, and halfway through a sentence you realize damn, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying, but now I\u2019ve started talking and I gotta finish this sentence, haha. It\u2019s like the brain needs contextual points of knowledge to learn the next thing, and some things are so far away from these basic knowledge nodes that you can\u2019t bridge the concept. Then you\u2019re like \u201cOh, it\u2019s like Uber for Mcdonalds?\u201d and it clicks all of a sudden. But what if you don\u2019t have that basic script where you have to really put two or three of those nodes together to bridge over to a new concept. Sometimes you have the right teacher and they know that\u2019s the case, and they\u2019ll build that out for you, but otherwise you\u2019re kind of reinventing the wheel in your mind, and for sure that can be so frustrating.\\n\\n### I\u2019m glad it clicked for you (and for me!). Who\u2019s your fav contributor, and why is it Stevie G?\\n\\nHaha, I love this question. I would say the thing that attracts me to Stevie G is his uncanny ability to come off as hyper-authentic. There\u2019s never a moment where I listen to him that I\u2019m not like, \u201cThis dude is so real, he\u2019s like, such a good human.\u201d Regardless of whether or not you are a good human, or you think you are, many times I come off as an asshole\u2014\\n\\n### Oh yeah, you don\u2019t need to tell me, coming off like an asshole unintentionally is a lowkey superpower of mine\u2026\\n\\nHahaha! But Stevie G, man, I never once get that impression from him. Stevie G is an authentic G.\\n\\n### Definitely. What would people be surprised to learn about you?\\n\\nHmm\u2026 Let\u2019s see\u2026 I\u2019m an avid mountain biker. I actually used to be an avid kite boarder, but I picked an occupation that\u2019s in direct conflict with kite boarding season. There was a point where I thought I may go pro. Hmm\u2026 other than that, as a child I was forced to do Hooked on Phonics, it\u2019s probably not funny for anybody under the age of 35 since it didn\u2019t exist for anybody that young, but like, when I had to do it, it was a joke, it was literally a joke that people would say to diss each other.\\n\\n### I remember that\u2026 it was a schoolyard way to call people dumb.\\n\\nRight! And when they said to to me I was like, \u201cYeah, actually, I am dumb!\u201d\\n\\n### Haha, to be honest that\u2019s a pretty awesome comeback! Thank you for taking the time, Mieos!\\n\\nThanks!"},{"id":"juicebox-in-the-world-of-nicholas","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-in-the-world-of-nicholas","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2022-05-31-juicebox-in-the-words-of-nicholas.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-31-juicebox-in-the-words-of-nicholas.md","title":"Juicebox in the Words of nicholas","description":"\u201cJuicebox in the words of\u201d is a series that highlights JB community members in interview form.

Learn about members\u2019 roles at JB and what makes them tick.*\\n\\n*Podcast extraordinaire and overall smooth talker nicholas took a bit out of his schedule to sit and, for a change, be the interviewee. Starting out as a JB contributor who went astray, the prodigal son is returning to the JB atmosphere with twice the gusto he had before. Don\u2019t call it a second coming, just call it finishing what he started. Read on to learn a bit about this erstwhile contributor-turned-vagabond, his aspirations at JB upon his return, and what his plans are for the future.*\\n\\n### How\u2019d you get started with JB and how has it changed since you\u2019ve been here?\\n\\nI found Juicebox originally in June/July of 2021, and I was one of the people who came in through the SharkDAO door. I was involved in SharkDAO and I got to meet some of the people there, and got to meet jango who was the lead protocol dev there. Eventually my interest turned primarily to JB. I\u2019ve always been interested in these tools that allow for social integration and JB was right up that alley in terms of tooling that lets people coordinate to create whatever project they want. On top of that they have this X factor which is the spirit of a true DAO\u2014 it\u2019s not about VC or cash grabs\u2014 and I think that\u2019s really interesting given the last 20 years or so of centralized social development in web2.\\n\\nI contributed at JB where I could, did a lot of governance, operations streamlining, starting tye notion library and working on organization. In early 2022 I decided to take a step back, focus a bit more on programming stuff, solidity, NFTs, etc. Over the course of a few months I realized I\u2019m just too fascinated by JB, and especially with V2 coming out and seeing this amazing potential. JB feels like an open source project with a revenue model, which is attracting incredible people from all over the world.\\n\\nSo I decided to jump back into JB. I put proposal in for trial payout and I\u2019m hoping I can jump back into the team.\\n\\n### There\u2019s a lot of excitement around V2. What specifically has you interested in coming back?\\n\\nTwo things are drawing me back\u2014 tankbottoms, who has been building/adapting stuff related to NFT creation and minting and turning those into tools that can be used more broadly. If it can be pulled off correctly, I think it\u2019ll go way beyond just JB. It\u2019s really revolutionary and applicable in so many different contexts. I feel like I can be useful there in design/code/helping out.\\n\\nThat\u2019s obviously enabled partly by V2. The treasury management stuff being discussed right now\u2014 like creating projects that allow you to diversify the treasury into other tokens, and using JB as mechanism for doing that\u2014 is extremely cool. V2 is so open-ended, and part of the lift involved is getting that tooling across to people.\\n\\n### I think that\u2019s a biggie. JB has so many tools, but I agree that it may be overwhelming for a newbie coming onto the scene. There\u2019s also a kind of idea like, if you spotted a restaurant that served Italian, Japanese, Greek and Turkish food, you may think okay, they can\u2019t possibly be doing all that correct. What do you make of that?\\n\\nYeah, for sure. What\u2019s great is that JB has really shown that it is aligned with memetic fundraisers in the past. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d call it product market fit (PMF) yet, but it has the orientation toward PMF with these memetic raises, some of them more enduring than others. Hopefully it can be useful for enduring long term treasury management functions.\\n\\nOne thing I think about\u2014 there\u2019s lot of NFT projects that set aside a portion of sales/royalties to  a treasury (which is sitting in a multisig somewhere). Maybe the collection lost momentum, who knows, but that funding is still hanging around somewhere. I have an assumption that there are dozens or more multisigs that belong to a DAO that have 50-250 ETH sitting in it without a lot of activity. If those things had been run on something like JB, maybe there could have been tools JB would have offered to make sure funds like that were put to use.\\n\\nI definitely do agree regarding the interface/tooling offerings\u2014 it\u2019ll be interesting to see what happens since JB is one interface right now, and that has value. But ultimately I think we\u2019ll see more interface experimentation. In the past when the Mandarin speakers came in, I was supportive of the idea to create some kind of interface that\u2019s more conducive to that new community group. As JB grows I think we may see things like that.\\n\\n### What do you think PMF looks like for JB?\\n\\nI\u2019m most interested in enduring projects that use the protocl as their treasury. I think\u2014and maybe my thinking has evolved on it\u2014 but last year as I got to understand JB in greater detail, I felt like there\u2019s two functions for DAOs. One is a place to hold your assets\u2014 that\u2019s JB\u2014 whether assets are ETH or NFTs or whatever\u2014 and the other a place where governance happens. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve figured out the most effective way to run governance, but JB governance works extremely well in my opinion. The way JB uses the treasury to handle contributor salary, other expenses, or the network effect when projects pay each other\u2014 for instance how JB relates to Wagmi, Canu, Peel, Lexicon Devils\u2014 collaborative DAOs end up holding a piece of each other and having a stake in each other\u2019s future. That has potential to have a serious network effect.\\n\\nLook at SharkDAO, they have a huge amount of JBX, in their case they don\u2019t really vote on stuff and their JBX isn\u2019t super valuable, but it would be nice to start to see that happen with partner DAOs.\\n\\nI think the thing we\u2019re missing is the NFT thing\u2014 that\u2019s the key in my opinion to returning revenue over time. Canu, Wagmi, etc., are paid through JB, so they can show how great the network is because they have locked in revenue from the revenue fees JB takes from all projects on the protocol. I think if we could create non-JB originating revenues, that would be fascinating.\\n\\n### Not to mention the landscape may be changing a bit here. Let\u2019s talk about \u201cSoulbound\u201d tokens (SBTs), which may be on the horizon. The idea here is tokens that are non-transferable. Some say good idea, others say it\u2019s just a way to make resumes in web3. What do you make of that?\\n\\nThe idea of non-transferable tokens\u2026 it\u2019s interesting. I think no matter what in web3, if you\u2019re an amazing code you will probably always get work. But that being said treating SBT\u2019s like a resume can definitely happen too. I have to say I haven\u2019t read the paper yet, so I\u2019m just going off of what I heard floating around the web3 space.\\n\\nLong term, there\u2019s a decent argument against it, which is that in ten years I don\u2019t think any of us will be using the same wallet. But overall, I think it\u2019s trying to answer the problem of these membership DAOs. If you base your membership on holding a market-tradable token, the appreciation of the token will ultimately result in the dilution of the quality of the members of your community as people sell.\\n\\nAlso JokeDAO comes to mind, where if you participate in their competition by submitting a joke, you get voting tokens for the subsequent competition.\\n\\n### One-time use tokens in other words.\\n\\nYes exactly. I think that\u2019s even more interesting to be honest. The ecosystem rewards people for trying new things and experimenting.\\n\\n### What about SBT\u2019s as a scarlet letter, in other words as a means to damage someone?\\n\\nFor sure that could happen, I think it will depend on the person minting and their reputation. One of the things about NFTs I wondered was people doing antisocial NFTs, like people tokenizing their virginity, or tokenizing school shooters.\\n\\n### Excellent points. Who\u2019s your favorite contributor, and why is it tankbottoms?\\n\\nHaha. Tankbottoms is great. There are so many great contributors honestly. If I had to point to anyone in particular, the person I admire most or seek to learn the most from is jango. There are many talented contributors, but jango has the talent I most wish I had\u2014 which is real clarity. It doesn\u2019t mean jango knows everything and everyone follows him. It means he has real clarity around orientation to questions. You could call it vision, but that maybe that\u2019s reductive. It\u2019s more like in discussions he\u2019s able to refocus very fluently. And of course being able to travel up and down the stack is incredible. Tankbottoms also is an unbelievable contributor in terms of accumulated experience and raw skill, which is so great. I mean, he\u2019s just turning out stuff that other teams talk about for a year, and tank turns it out like that.\\n\\n### What is something people would be surprised to learn about you?\\n\\nLately I\u2019ve been doing kickboxing every week with my girlfriend and roommate. I\u2019m also a total youtube fanatic and I rarely watch under 2x speed. My biggest interest for the past little while is in Magic the Gathering! A friend gave me the idea that we\u2019re like the CPUs when we play MtG, and the game is the rules of machine, and\u2026 it\u2019s like if javascript was run by a company and the only thing you could exercise and execute were functions that are sold 10 times a year. I\u2019m really fascinated by it. I also love going on really long walks, like for hours and hours.\\n\\n### What does the future have in store for nicholas?\\n\\nI\u2019m working on an NFT collection, actually, that I\u2019m really pumped about. I can\u2019t share anything just yet, it\u2019s not finalized, but once it\u2019s ready I\u2019ll let everyone know about it!\\n\\n(This interview was stylized from a discord call, and shortened for brevity.

Bug updates by @jango \\n\\n@Jango: The same bug update that I presented about last week that we caught about a week ago. As of a few mins ago about 95% got resolved to just the final step of re-issuing the tokens for those who contributed to projects before we re-deployed things. \\n\\nEverything is being tracked in the [postmortem](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/blob/main/security/postmortem/5.24.2022.md) that is the V2 contract repository. I\u2019m very excited to tie that off and make progress on all other stuff coming up. Also project creation is back up.\\n\\nfilipv: I am gonna ask about litDAO specifically. Are they holding back token narration for all projects right now?\\n\\njango: We\u2019re gonna run a script to help go through play by play of what we\u2019re doing. We re-deployed basically all the contracts except for Juicebox projects(so they can keep their NFT i.e. the ownership to the projects) and a few auxiliary contracts that don\u2019t have dependency. We re-deployed the token contract, funding cycle store, the terminals, etc. Once projects re-launch their funding cycles, everyone starts from Funding cycle #1 again. The front end made it very easy to use the same configurations as their previous funding cycle in the old contract had. Once they make that, they also have 0 token supply in the new token contract. But several projects have already received funds and started distributing tokens.\\n\\nThe original plan was to have project owners initiate a few transactions to airdrop tokens to their token holders, which is super doable but requires 3-4 transactions and it\u2019s a bit complicated. In general, the scope of the problem is very small, given where we are in the protocol deployed a few weeks ago. So instead, I\u2019m gonna send a few transactions that we scripted after this Town Hall that\u2019s gonna deposit and basically re-created the activities for each project. Let\u2019s say moonmars have received 10 payments each with its memo and it beneficiary of token. We\u2019ll just send those out again. And from the deployer wallet as we run the script, we will pay in some ETH and set the original beneficiary of tokens as a beneficiary. So once all the activities are up again, then the token balance of each project should reflect their old token balance. I\u2019ll open a proposal to refund the deployer.\\n\\n@filipv: So are we repaying all the balance that all the V2 projects have received so far?\\n\\n@jango: I think the total will be 11ETH if all projects are to relaunch funding cycles, which is a prerequisite, and then we\u2019ll drop the funds in both as a bonus for everybody for the hiccup, and also thanks for the patience throughout this process. I think it\u2019s better to solve this problem with money, than to cause poor UX, and I think it\u2019s worthy given its scale. But this also taught us a lot about how to solve this problem given a larger scope. That loss is in lieu of communication headaches that cause us to make sure that the projects are clicking the right button and not getting themselves into other nuts. \\n\\n@filipv: Are we doing reimbursement for gas fees associated with redeployment and project updates?\\n\\n@jango: Yes. The big one is projects that have deployed ERC-20, which is the most expensive transaction. We have a list of projects that have that before, and we\u2019ll drop in 0.2ETH in their treasury, which is part of the number I quoted before. After this call, I\u2019ll run it and we\u2019ll be super in the clear and make moves towards the stuff we were working on before.\\n\\n@filipv: Last question, what\u2019s going on with the ETH in the V2 projects right now on the old version of the contract? Can project creators just distribute it if they\u2019d like to, or figure out what they\u2019re gonna do with it?\\n\\n@jango: For the most part those have been distributed. I went through to empty those out as the UI no longer interacts with them. You can always go to etherscan.io to pull them out. I think litDAO has a 100% overflow, so any funds in there can be redeemed by token holders. So if you did contribute to the DAO before, it\u2019s now a fine time to go and redeem, or they can submit a reconfiguration on the old funding cycle to raise and pull funds out. It\u2019s the bonus we\u2019re going to give them if they want to go to the trouble to get those, which is for them to choose.\\n\\nOnce we found this bug, it was tempting for us to just keep our heads down, mitigate it and try to fix it. But communicating with projects and making sure everyone understands what\u2019s going on is important, so it\u2019s certainly cool to do stuff and prod. \\n\\nIt\u2019s still pretty incredible that we found this bizarrely niche bug this early on. I\u2019m pretty confident here going forward. It\u2019s kind of weird to start and then already have a bug. I definitely understand if there\u2019s a sense of hesitancy. I\u2019ll have to work through that, give it time and put weight on it incrementally and regain trust in ourselves. I feel pretty good about it.\\n\\n## 2. Morgenstern\u2019s Ice Cream event by @Zom_Bae and @Kenbot: \\n \\n@Zom_Bae: If you haven\u2019t been keeping up, Morgenstern\u2019s Finest Ice Cream is hosting a JuiceboxDAO event for three days over NFT NYC. We, as a DAO, got to vote on 6 custom unique ice cream flavors, which is pretty cool. Check out [this link](https://juicebox.notion.site/ICE-CREAM-FLAVOR-SUBMISSIONS-c84ed139d9a64bf68099a210942b98db), and submit your crazy wacky creations by June 2. On that day we\u2019ll get a list compiled and vote on Discord for the top 6, which are going to be tweaked and refined by Nicholas Morgenstern himself and then be served at our event over the 3 days.\\n\\nKenbot and I over the last week have been really digging into this and finding a way to make it more than just an ice cream social. And I think we\u2019ve got a really unique opportunity here to bring some really cool projects into Juicebox and get them building in the protocol, and also really get the word out for Juicebox. \\n\\nWe\u2019ve been talking for a long time that Juicebox hasn\u2019t really done a whole lot of marketing other than our twitter, word of mouth, and the big one-off projects like ConstitutionDAO and AssangeDAO. We are still in early phases for that, but the ice cream social the way it\u2019s building up is gonna be an event inside an event of NFT NYC. We\u2019re going to have a schedule of things going on each day. We\u2019d love to do some twitter space, AMA and podcast if we can.\\n\\nLexicon Devils are making a replica of this event in [cryptovoxels.com](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/spaces/344a9048-9c09-462e-9d76-f292185922a9/play) , which is pretty cool.\\n\\nSo any of you is gonna be in NY for this event and is willing and able and down to be a part of that, I really want you to be.\\n\\n@kenbot: What we\u2019re thinking about is we can have their windows as soon as we can get going. So we can have a week running up before the event to promote right in the space what we are gonna be doing there. The thought is who do we want to reach out to, who\u2019s walking by that place, who\u2019s in downtown NY at that time, and we want to capture and have them come back.\\n\\nSo that\u2019s going to be ideas that we can have a theme of bringing creatives together, to open their Juicebox projects and fund their dream projects. \\n\\n## 3. Stories about BlockSpilt and NFT Berlin by @Zeugh:\\n\\n@Zeugh: Me and JohnnyD have been going around for the last week. We\u2019ve started the idea of testing the gorilla marketing tactics, by going to some blockchain, Ethereum or NFT conferences. This time we went to BlockSplits in Croatia and NFT Berlin so far. \\n\\n### 1) BlockSplits\\n\\nWe got to BlockSplit on Tuesday last week. First thing we swa was a panel of legal side of things about new regulations in the EU and it felt like this was the wrong place to be. We came to this event for 2 main goals. The first one was to do some user research, try to listen to people that are creating projects, and try to understand how they currently manage their treasury. And the other idea was to onboard some of them. The event ended up evolving into something we understand as Web2.5. BlockSplit Croatia was more of using  blockchain technologies on traditional startups. \\n\\nInteresting insights from BlockSplit were, there were some L2 builders from Boba network and they were interested in how we can bring Juicebox to their L2. I found it unusual that there will actually be people building L2 looking for people to go into their chains. I talked to them and onboarded them to our server. They want to come on and discuss how they could help a process like this to happen. \\n\\nAlso from BlockSplit, there was a very interesting group called Resolute that focuses on web3 marketing. They got very interested in how we\u2019re doing things and how they can help with that. I am bringing them to our server this week for them to take a look at our strategy discussion and the marketing part.\\n\\nEveryone got interested in how we are doing things actually, no one has ever seen a DAO actually run and work with a profitable and functional business model. \\n\\n### 2) NFT Berlin\\n\\nFrom BlockSplit we flew to Berlin, and NFT Berlin was the opposite of BlockSplit, where most people were not directly involved with a project, they were mostly collectors and fans of the whole NFT fever.\\n\\nIn there we got in depth looks at what NFT creation could use Juicebox for. JohnnyD was amazing in focusing in how we can create better models using Juicebox, some templates or preset configurations that could be useful for NFT creators, to give their buyers or investors more confidence in investing, to make sure that if a rug pull happens everyone has time to pull back. Those features made everyone\u2019s eyes shine.\\n\\nWe got in touch with NFT Club Berlin. They are a big local group of NFT investors and collectors. We have follow-up calls this week to show them how to use the templates so that they can start referencing that in their community.\\n\\nThe experience as a whole was great beyond the event itself. We stayed for the hackathon, helped people on the hackathon deploy or understand something about our products. We got invited for the ETH Barcelona to be part of the hackathon there to help them get DAO hackathon. They are interested in having us as the main DAO on that, because we were one of those that does have an actual toolkit and a workshop and content to provide for a hackathon. \\n\\nAnd we faced the problem of gas fee in NFT Berlin again and again, for the fact that we only run on Ethereum was definitely a barrier for some project creators that we talked to.\\n\\n### 3) Discussion\\n\\n@filip: Do you feel like what you learned from those events changed your strategy? Do you still feel the same way about the strategy?\\n\\n@Zeugh: I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know, because the strategy has been going back and forth from different talks, so I\u2019m not sure if I have a clear feeling before saying it has changed.\\n\\nI definitely feel more confident on going projects to projects in an event, just talking about Juicebox, asking what people are doing and how they are doing. I learned better the right questions to ask to understand if we can provide value to them or not, and to learn why we can why we can\u2019t.\\n\\nI think the most beneficial part was the user research part beyond the few projects we onboarded. I think it was the biggest gain.\\n\\n\\n## 4. Quizz time: \\n\\n![](quizz.png)\\n\\nThe answer is\u2026\u2026     Casstoshi!\\n\\n## 5. Hello from ComicsDAO by @gogo: \\n\\n@gogo: I\u2019m really excited about the V2 release, and ComicsDAO will be dropping really soon. I have just to create the Gnosis and the multisig, and we\u2019ll be dropping soon. You guys should know what we are doing. We do some cool things already with covers of ComicsDAO.

Burtula has posted a new animation of a Banny (Peach Banny to be precise) getting kidnapped in her sleep. Mieos likes it, but suggests smoothing it out, so the kidnapping can seem more natural. Tankbottoms is asking about asset folders to be filled out, and Sage is coming off being stranded in Idaho with a transmission-less car and working feverishly through her phone.\\n\\nIt\u2019s only 8:30am. The day is just beginning. Felix has spent the better part of two days sourcing custom-made condoms\u2014 tri-fold condoms, to be exact, so each Banny can have their own condom packaging, with a pop-out tri-fold to really bring the point home. A banny wrapped in the coital experience, Felixander would tell you, is the most salient testament to the human condition.\\n\\n### 12:00pm\\n\\nBurtula is taking Mieos\u2019 words of advice to heart. After all, if a banny is going to get kidnapped, that should look natural. What will future customers think if such a traumatic experience seems rushed or premature? Premature\u2014 Felix is thinking of a joke, but he\u2019s abstaining. She works tirelessly to craft the Peach banny with more finesse, and in the wait one wonders about banny backgrounds\u2014 are we even saving all of them?\\n\\n5 creative people stuffed into a studio, and not a shred of organizational prowess between them. Do we have a Peach Banny background? Of course we do. But where is it? Oh yeah, it\u2019s in one of the thirteen discord channels at Wagmi, and it was posted a month ago. It may as well be in the ether, but that doesn\u2019t stop us all from scrolling up wildly to find it.\\n\\nMeanwhile tankbottoms is white knuckling it on at least hour 36 of a god-knows-how-long working sprint. His work pace has Cocaine saying bro, slow down, you\u2019re harshing my vibe here. We try to get in touch with him, but on hour 36 the quality of response you can expect is a bit frayed to put it mildly. Tankbottoms operates on a bonding curve of consciousness\u2014 if you get your request in early, he will deliver a fucking spectacular answer. But if you\u2019re in that last 5 hour span, you\u2019re gonna get caught holding the bag.\\n\\n### 5:00pm\\n\\nMeanwhile we\u2019re trying to get a presentation on some UI from Sage. The Figma files are fire, and between randomly being jailed and what one can only assume is the wisdom derived from several ayahuasca trips, Sage delivers. She elegantly goes though all the work she\u2019s put into the latest UI iteration, and everyone is blown away and gives her praises, but she has to cut it short because a coyote chewing on some old cigarettes by a roadside is giving her the stink eye, and it may get nasty.\\n\\nThey ask Felix what he thinks about the UI, but all he can think about is how a single tri-fold condom costs $1.64, but if we get ten thousand that price goes down to $0.46 per unit. He wants to make a joke about units, but he abstains. He\u2019s crafting an email asking how many banana-pictures they can print on a single tri-fold, and he\u2019s doing the math and thinking that we can make condoms cool, one self-referential banana at a time. He\u2019s wondering if we can turn this all into a romance novel, where the Bannies fuck each other in only the most pleasant of language.\\n\\n### 8:00pm\\n\\nWe look to Mieos for guidance, but he\u2019s on a treasure hunt deep in cryptovoxels, and he\u2019s trying to embed 12 seed phrases the best he can and he\u2019s having a blast doing it. Meanwhile Burtula is waiting for an answer about her animation, and people may be ready to start considering it, but just at that moment tank is wondering why these blog posts are even generated by lowly meatsacks like Felix\u2014 can\u2019t all this shit be generated on chain?\\n\\n### 12:00am\\n\\nFor this hour, nothing really happens at all, and nobody is working on anything.\\n\\n### 1:00am\\n\\nThe day is winding down. Condoms have been designed for an order that\u2019s never likely to happen. An animation is still waiting to be fine-tuned. Sage is coming off some hard psychedelics, or at least she should be for the amount of work she does. Tank is crashing for the next 47 hours. Mieos sits back in a recliner with a cat that he caresses knowingly, cackling into the moonlight as he reflects on another solid day.\\n\\nNothing finalized, nothing completed. Incremental progress happened, but the struggle continues the next day. But a hell of a lot of fun was had."},{"id":"juicebox-in-the-world-of-aeolian","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-in-the-world-of-aeolian","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2022-05-24-juicebox-in-the-world-of-aeolian.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-24-juicebox-in-the-world-of-aeolian.md","title":"Juicebox in the Words of aeolian","description":"\u201cJuicebox in the words of\u201d is a series that highlights JB community members in interview form.

Learn about members\u2019 roles at JB and what makes them tick.*\\n\\n*aeolian is a longtime JB member and a front-end wizard. He has worked tirelessly for the JB cause and seemingly writes lines of code in his sleep. Lately he has championed discussions around how we evaluate compensation in the DAO, and most recently has submitted a proposal (in-process as of this writing) to reduce payouts across all JB contributors. Read on to learn a bit more about this front-end developer turned fiscal activist.*\\n\\n### How\u2019d you get started with JB and how has it changed since you\u2019ve been here?\\n\\nBefore JB, and technically even now, I\u2019ve been a software engineer in the traditional web2 space working for startups, etc. I\u2019ve been loosely dabbling in crypto over the years, but I always wanted to dive into it in a bigger way. Generally when I want to dive into something, I really wanna get into the nuts/bolts and learn it from the ground up. I finally found myself with the time to do that, and me and a couple friends found this NFT project we liked, and even though we couldn\u2019t really afford to buy the NFT separately, if we pull our funds together\u2026 and it was like a lightbulb moment. We thought hey, what about this whole DAO thing happening\u2014 what if we make a DAO that buys some NFTs. So I found JB and started poking around, and it was coincidentally the same time that ConstitutionDAO was happening. I was drawn in by the amazing branding of Banny (a banana smoking a joint was just amazing) and the next day I wake up, log into discord, and I see the treasury has grown to like 20 million overnight. Once I saw that and started really thinking about the potential of this thing I immediately dropped everything I was doing and started trying to contribute where I could, especially on the dev side and front-end side. Peri welcomed us with open arms and the rest is history as they say.\\n\\n### Awesome. So much talk lately about V2! How would you put V2 in perspective for someone not technically aware of all the changes?\\n\\nV2, hmm. When we talk about V2 we\u2019re talking about the protocol itself. Jango, Drgorilla and a bunch of others have identified some tings about V1 which were restrictive, like that projects can only raise money in ETH and not in other currencies, that there\u2019s less flexibility around how they can configure projects to meet their needs, and so on. The protocol guys said let\u2019s start developing V2 and improve it from the ground up, and so the front-end\u2019s job in that is basically to support those new additions. There\u2019s exciting potential use cases, like funding your project through your own NFT launch, or like a project that comes along that says we want to award contributors with an NFT that they can sell on secondary market, and the proceeds of those NFTs will go straight into a JB treasury. Another biggie is supporting multi-currencies\u2014 projects accepting stablecoins instead of just ETH. Truthfully we don\u2019t even know all the possibilities that it is hopefully going to open up, which is what makes it all the more exciting.\\n\\n### I\u2019m reminded of the story of that city planner in England way back when, who had the roads built twice as wide as necessary. People thought he was crazy, but he saw a future with population explosion. Do you view V2 as built for the realities of tomorrow?\\n\\nHaha, I super admire anyone that can have that kind of forethought and conviction in their idea of the future. When you\u2019re building a protocol as the ecosystem saw with V1, it enables a set of use cases which, in the case of V1, proved to be successful with big fundraisers that make big volume in a short amount of time. Look at the internet\u2013 such a non-restrictive, base-level protocol, and look at it now. The creators of the internet would have had no idea that it would become what it is now. Not unlike JB with this website of this smoking banana that enables millions of dollars of fundraising.\\n\\n### There\u2019s been this wonderful discussion about compensation lately. Where does a DAO strike a balance between compensating members and staying lean for a down-the-line bigger payout?\\n\\nIt\u2019s really hard. Like someone said in that thread on compensation\u2014 I don\u2019t remember who\u2014 but comparing people based on a number is just not healthy, right? That\u2019s what people don\u2019t like about traditional corporate life, and that\u2019s why people find themselves in web3 and crypto. They want to escape that world and operate in a space that lets them do what interests them the most. In terms of how to think about it from a first-principles perspective, which I\u2019m trying to do, let\u2019s start with startups. I don\u2019t think the startup model is perfect by any means\u2013 it probably disproportionately rewards the founders more than early builders. So that\u2019s not exactly a blueprint for us either.\\n\\n### It\u2019s just so complicated right? So many smart people and no one has been able to find that holy grail answer...\\n\\nRight. And drawing from the corporate world and those structures probably is not the right way to go about it either. I\u2019m not a crypto/web3 maximalist in that sense though, I do think people can learn things from those who have come before us, but we\u2019re here to make our own rules and to do what makes sense for us and what leads to the most amazing ecosystem that we can possibly build. That\u2019s what we\u2019re all here to do. The fact that that thread exists and other threads like it exist is a real testament to this community because we\u2019re driven and passionate about figuring this stuff out. That, in my opinion, is the sign of a really healthy community.\\n\\n### No egos can be around in this right\u2013 how come egos don\u2019t seem to clash more in these situations?\\n\\nThere\u2019s something about JB, or the way that the community presents itself, whether on socials or within the discord, that it leads to a certain type of person sticking around. People are sufficiently motivated at JB. When teams break apart and things don\u2019t happen it\u2019s because people gave up on figuring out how to make it work. Everyone here recognizes the opportunity we have in front of us, to build this amazing thing and a solid foundation for us to all go forward. It\u2019s a recognition that if we can really sit down and work all this stuff out we\u2019re really gonna be able to build amazing things.\\n\\n### Do you think the JB runway threatened by the compensation models we have now? JB never had any VC coming in, so how do you reconcile that?\\n\\nThat\u2019s the key point\u2013 and I\u2019ve been guilty of this in the past myself\u2014 JB is very unique and the dynamics of the ecosystem are crazy. We really do have to think about this stuff. We have to sit down and think about it from a first-principles perspective, rather than approaching it in the traditional way of doing these things.\\n\\n### What about the workflow over time problem\u2013 ie, what happens when your job drops off in work to do because you executed the task, but you\u2019re still getting this big recurring payout?\\n\\nThat\u2019s the biggie, you\u2019ve hit the nail on the head. One model we\u2019ve stewarded is that the front-end team has broken out into its own treasury in Peel, and that allows us to be more intentional with how we fund projects. It really allows two things: we can onboard quickly those who we think are really good, and we can also understand their skill set right away. We know what we\u2019re looking for and the broader DAO doesn\u2019t have to go in and make a decision on every single recurring payout proposal that comes through that affects the front-end. That\u2019s one model that\u2019s been working for us, but these things are all emerging, and that what makes me super excited to be here in JB and in web3.\\n\\n### Got it. Okay, let\u2019s get down to brass tacks. Who\u2019s your favorite JB member, and why is it jango?\\n\\nJango said something a while ago that really nails home why he\u2019s so amazing, and the culture he\u2019s ushered in at JB. I\u2019m just gonna quote it here:\\n\\n*\u201ci like hangin with folks that can be fluid between bullshitting and manifesting, fluid between appreciating beauty and ugly, fluid between conversation and silence, fluid between humor and practicality, fluid between been in awe of everything and focusing on the next idea in front of us. I\'m attracted as fuck to people with big imaginations who make moves towards them.\u201d*\\n\\nThat was like such an amazing statement because it\u2019s really hard to find people who are *your* people. I feel like my people are this: people who strike that balance between brilliance and focus, but also are able to laugh at the ridiculousness of life, and so I guess when I read that I was like damn, I will definitely be vibing here for many years.\\n\\nBut my homies at Peel definitely need a huge shoutout. This is the dream team and I\'m super lucky to be a part of it.\\n\\n### What\u2019s something that people would be surprised to learn about you?\\n\\nHmm\u2026 I don\u2019t really know. I guess one thing is that I started programming very late, and I actually always wanted to be a film composer\u2014 writing music for movies. That\u2019s what I was doing before becoming a software engineer. Through high school I was pretty much all about music; I played piano and a bunch of other instruments and I got really into writing music for film, and I thought I would take that road. Eventually I kind of just realized it wasn\u2019t coming from a place of pure passion and excitement.

By the end of it, you\u2019ll have set up a system where: \\r\\n1. Buyers of your NFT will automatically receive a quantifiable stake in your project\u2019s treasury in the form of ERC20 tokens.\\r\\n2. People can invest in your project without having to own an NFT. \\r\\n3. Automate payments to your key team members and display them transparently to your community. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn this article you\u2019ll learn:\\r\\n* How to create and configure a Juicebox project suited for an NFT collection\\r\\n* How to link royalty fees from your NFT sales to your shared Juicebox treasury\\r\\n\\r\\n## 1. Create your project\\r\\n\\r\\n![](image1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n*[https://juicebox.money/#/create](https://juicebox.money/#/create) or [https://rinkeby.juicebox.money/#/create](https://rinkeby.juicebox.money/#/create) (testnet)*\\r\\n\\r\\nI\u2019ll go from the Funding cycle section of our create flow and recommend some possible starting points for your NFT project.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 1. Funding \\r\\n\\r\\n#### Funding cycles\\r\\nWe highly recommend using a funding cycle. This is the time period over which distributions will be made and other Juicebox settings such as the discount rate will be applied. Common funding cycle lengths are 1 week, 2 weeks or 1 month.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Distributions\\r\\nYou can specify the amount you\u2019d like to distribute to each member of your team per funding cycle from the treasury. If you don\u2019t raise the total amount of funds you\u2019ve planned for your whole team, then each team member will be paid the percentage you\u2019ve specified for them from any funds you have raised. For instance, if you planned for Mike and Bob to get 1 ETH each per week, but you only raised 1 ETH total in a certain week, then they will just get 0.5 ETH each. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\u2019re opting not to go for the shared treasury approach, you can route all funds from the treasury straight to the owner, or a percentage cut to any other wallet address.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Token\\r\\n#### Reserved rate\\r\\nAs mentioned earlier, whenever new tokens are minted as a result of someone buying an NFT or contributing for tokens straight up, this percentage of those new tokens will be reserved and the rest will go to the buyer. By default, these tokens are reserved for the project owner, but you can also allocate portions to other wallet addresses. A reserved rate of 50% will ensure the project owners maintain a majority share of the treasury and may be a good option for your project. \\r\\n\\r\\n#### Discount rate\\r\\nThe discount rate incentivises people to get in early on your project. It controls how the issue rate of your community ERC20 token changes over time. A higher discount rate means people who buy your NFT in the early days will receive more tokens / ETH than those who come in later. An exact figure is hard to give, but with a funding cycle length of 2 weeks, a discount rate of 10% may be a good place to start.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Redemption rate\\r\\nThis redemption rate encourages token holders to hodl and stick with your project token for the long term. On a lower redemption rate, redeeming a token increases the value of each remaining token, creating an incentive to hold tokens longer than other holders. Similar to the discount rate, you\u2019ll have to gauge how aggressively you want to pull this level, but a redemption rate between 50 and 75% is probably a good place to start. \\r\\n\\r\\n### 3. Rules\\r\\n#### Pause payments\\r\\nYou probably don\u2019t want to check this. Check it only if you want to hold off payments for a certain period after you create your project.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Allow token minting\\r\\nYou probably don\u2019t want to check this either, it allows project owners to mint any amount of tokens to anyone on demand. Whenever you have this enabled, your project will have a warning flag on its Juicebox page warning contributors of the possibility of their tokens being diluted. \\r\\n\\r\\n#### Reconfiguration\\r\\nThis is important. It restricts how long before the next funding cycle reconfigurations must be submitted before they are able to take effect. For example, with a 3-day delay (a good starting point), a reconfiguration to an upcoming funding cycle must be submitted at least 3 days before it starts. It\u2019s a great way to ensure your community against any malicious owner behavior. \\r\\n\\r\\n## 2. Create a payable address\\r\\n\\r\\nThis will create an Ethereum address that can be used to pay your project, rather than having to go through the Juicebox interface. It will be necessary in the model of the Juicebox NFT project we\u2019re going for, since you will use this address as the destination for your royalty fees. You will be prompted to do this when you create your project, but can do it later at any time in the \u2018Tools\u2019 section of your project page pictured below. \\r\\n\\r\\n![](image2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n## 3. Do your thang on Opensea, or wherever. Send royalty fees to the payable address. Let the magic happen \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that\u2019s it! Congratulations. You\u2019ve set up a system where buyers of your NFT will have a quantifiable stake in your project with community tokens (ERC20), and have allowed people to invest in your project without having to own an NFT. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Conclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nWe hope you\u2019ve enjoyed digging into the details of Juicebox and how you can leverage the protocol for your NFT project.

Funding and operating an NFT project with Juicebox is an especially effective way to leverage the protocol, providing massive benefits to both owners and their communities. In this article we\u2019ll cover why, and [in a follow-up article, we\u2019ll cover how](/blog/how-juicebox-for-nfts).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this article: \\r\\n1. Basics of the Juicebox protocol.\\r\\n2. Why Juicebox NFT projects are better.\\r\\n3. What does it cost?\\r\\n\\r\\n## 1. Basics of Juicebox\\r\\nJuicebox allows people and communities to crowdfund their project and give their contributors a stake as community tokens (ERC20) in return. Once funds have been raised, the protocol can be leveraged to automate payments from the treasury in a controlled, transparent and decentralized fashion. \\r\\n\\r\\n## 2. Why Juicebox NFT projects are better\\r\\nJuicebox NFT projects are a win-win for both communities and owners. There are countless ways you can configure your Juicebox project for your specific goals, but here\u2019s a general strategy we recommend for NFT projects: \\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of sending your NFT royalty fees directly to the owner\u2019s wallet, you can send them to a shared treasury owned by your community. Upon buying an NFT (and paying the royalty fee), the new owners of your NFT\u2019s would automatically receive an amount of your community tokens proportional to their purchase amount. The more someone pays for an NFT, the more tokens they receive. This gives your community members a formal and quantifiable stake in the shared treasury - your project as a whole. Your community could also contribute and gain stake in your project by just buying tokens, not necessarily having to own an NFT. \\r\\n\\r\\n### For communities \\r\\n#### Token value \\r\\nYou can use these tokens for anything you want, perhaps governance, raffles or exclusive access to future drops. But a unique feature of Juicebox is that it allows the option for these tokens to be redeemed by community members for a portion of your project\u2019s treasury. As the pie grows over time, a contributor\u2019s tokens will be worth more. Your community can gain on top of just the increase in value of their NFT\u2019s.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving a shared treasury is optional, however, and you could instead just have all royalty fees sent to the Juicebox project route straight to the creators. In this case, the token your community receives could not be redeemed for any ETH. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Your community can gain on top of just the increase in value of their NFT\u2019s.**\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Trust and transparency \\r\\n\\r\\nFirstly, a properly configured Juicebox project makes rug-pulls impossible. You can give your community time to react before any changes to your funding and spending parameters take effect. \\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, your Juicebox page shows exactly how all your funds are flowing - how much and where it\u2019s coming from, and where those funds are subsequently being spent. The only way funds can leave the treasury is by configuring and scheduling a payment, for which your community will always have time to react to. \\r\\n\\r\\n![](image1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n*Spending (left) and income (right) shown on a project\u2019s Juicebox page*\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may be asking, *\u201cOk I see the benefit for my community, but what\u2019s in it for the owner?\\"*\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### For owners\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Maintain a high stake in your project using the Reserved Rate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you choose the option of your token holders being able to redeem from a shared treasury, we should mention that as an owner you can control exactly how much stake you maintain of this treasury over time. The reserved rate allows you to keep a portion of all newly minted tokens. A 50% reserved rate means you will maintain a 50% ownership of treasury no matter how big your project gets. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is mostly irrelevant if you don\u2019t want a shared treasury and to simply route all funds into the project straight to creators. \\r\\n\\r\\n#### Allow for people to contribute to your project without buying an NFT and, therefore, raise more funds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis model opens up a massive and mostly untapped market of people interested in investing in an NFT project without necessarily buying an NFT. Whether it be too high of a floor price, not wanting to go through the whole selection/auction/listing process, or anything else, Juicebox opens the door of your project to these people through community tokens.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider if the projects like the Bored Apes had followed this model - how much more funds could the creators have raised as a result of people buying some stake worth less than the purchase price of a Bored Ape? \\r\\n\\r\\nHow much more funds could the [Bored Apes] creators have raised as a result of people buying some stake worth less than the purchase price of a Bored Ape? \\r\\n\\r\\n#### Automate payments to key members of your team.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\u2019re going for the shared treasury approach, Juicebox allows you to pre-program specific distribution amounts from your treasury to any ETH address, e.g. pay vitalik.eth US$1000 every week. This saves the hassle of manually transferring funds to your team from your personal or shared multisig wallet. \\r\\n\\r\\nOtherwise, as mentioned prior, you can simply route all funds from the project to creators and their teams. \\r\\n\\r\\n## 3. What does it cost?\\r\\n\\r\\nUp front, all Juicebox costs is gas. As of the 23th of May, it\u2019s about US$150-200 worth of gas to launch your project, deploy your own ERC20 token and a payable ETH address for you to link your royalty fees to. Then, for any funds you end up withdrawing from your project\u2019s treasury, you\u2019ll pay a 2.5% fee to Juicebox. But, for this 2.5% cut of your payout distributions, you\u2019ll receive Juicebox\u2019s native token (JBX) in return at its current issue rate. Moreover, your fee will give you a growing stake of Juicebox\u2019s expanding ecosystem and treasury. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Conclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nIf this has already been enough information for one reading, feel free to tap out now. But if we\u2019ve piqued your interest at all, you may want to read on about exactly how you\u2019d setup your Juicebox NFT project here (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xqj5AyG8pZcpdtbxYfOzqwIaMNyrhQZPfVhfsUpYw1M/edit).

A bug saga by @jango \\n\\nJango: This morning STVG posted at the loose_thoughts channel: What if we could pause a project mid-Funding cycle? He was trying to play with the Marine County Swim Association project(this is a sweet event pulled off by STVG) to pause it since the event was finished. And through a series of botched configurations, the project ended up in a really weird state. The project\u2019s current funding cycle is set to start on May 28th which makes no sense as the current funding cycle should always be active. \\n\\nSo at this point, something is for sure up or at least not served correctly or the front end isn\u2019t interpreting correctly. That\u2019s quick to check. The etherscan.io confirmed that the current funding cycle starts at a later day. I went to check the unit tests and there were a bunch of cases that I felt this was trying to cover and still passing. So I tried to create the situation exactly and was still struggling to do so. What ended up being the exact step to follow to recreate the bug which I eventually found was: if you create a funding cycle or configure a funding cycle with a duration and then let it roll over to the next funding cycle without reconfiguring, now you\u2019re in the 2nd funding cycle, now you\u2019re in the 2nd funding cycle of the 1st configuration. Then you configure the subsequent one, and before the current cycle is over, you reconfigure the subsequent one again to override the previous configuration. If you\u2019re in this exact state, the 2nd reconfiguration, instead of being based on the 1st FC which you kinda rolling over onto, will be based on the funding cycle you are going to override. \\n\\nThat puts us in a weird state. The edge case was not covered in the tests. So I quickly wrote a test and confirmed it, before I found the one line to add to the contract to fix the problem to make the test pass, which I\u2019ll post here:\\n![](code.png)\\n\\nSo once we identified the problem, sorry I\'m kind of doing a realtime postmortem here and I\u2019ll write this up later, then we can start to think about the solutions and consequences. Luckily V2 was deployed only recently and there are only 27 projects at the time. And most projects don\u2019t have large volumes in their treasury either, the bug doesn\u2019t affect the treasuries so funds are all safe, too. \\n\\nAll we are gonna do is letting these projects know that this condition exists, and from our point of view, we should probably make the adjustment in the funding cycle store which is a dependency like all other contracts or the core contracts in the ecosystem which is gonna nudge us towards republishing and redeploying the V2 contacts. \\n\\nIt\u2019s not 100% sure that we need to redeploy the project contract, which will be nice with all the NFT stays. Even if we do, we can get in touch with all these projects, make sure they can redeploy on the new version, make sure funds get moved over and make sure token holders get airdropped the new supply of the token.\\n\\nThis comes in the name of diverse conversion stuff we have been talking about. We know we are working with fragile and delicate infrastructure. I am happy to catch this very early on in the process, as this V2 stuff just gets trickier over time. And then obviously if you  were to know about it and think about it maliciously, it\u2019s an exploit if you want to use it in that way.\\n\\nA big shout out to folks involved to kinda come through and help once we wrapped our heads around the issue. Peri came in right away and adjusted some of the front end to make sure new projects can not be created on juicebox.money. And shout out to STVG for clicking a button which you described as chaotic and you weren\u2019t really sure if you miss-clicked a few things, or you did a couple of things twice because you forgot to do it. That ended up showing us the way.\\n\\nIt\u2019s pretty mind-blowing that that was a test case we have yet to cover. And it\u2019s hard to believe there are any more of these lingering. The scope of these contracts is pretty tight. I think V2 actually removed bits and pieces of funding cycles, so the V2 funding cycle store is way leaner than the V1 one. I haven\u2019t checked if the contracts of V1 have the same vulnerability in it, but I actually don\u2019t think they do because that piece of logic got reassessed. \\n\\n@filipv: Huge shout out to everybody esp. STVG. This is so good that this was found now instead of 3 months from now.\\n\\n@0xSTVG: I\u2019ll ask my original question. Is there a way to pause? I\u2019m in a 5-day funding cycle, I reached my goal so I wanted to just pause payment even though I am in the middle of the funding cycle. I can\u2019t do that, I can pause it but it\u2019s going to take effect only when the current funding cycle is over.\\n@jango: yeah, you can set up a pay delegate to revert the transaction if you\u2019ve met a goal, you could write an extension that just does that if you want. But by default you can\u2019t. Once we put it on the shelf then you\u2019ll be able to pull it off the shelf and use it, but we have to build it out first.\\n\\nIt feels like it\u2019s at a lighter moment now. Most of the morning was pretty tense on my end at least, and obviously we take these things very seriously, make sure we\u2019re articulating this stuff correctly and documenting that correctly. I think we are still all gonna make it.\\n\\nAll V2 projects on the site currently have a sweet alert on them. Hopefully all the communities running on it, not just project owners we reached out, see this warning and get a heads up for what\u2019s going on. Thank you Peri, for coming through.\\n\\n![](project.png)\\n\\n ## 2. Demo of veBanny by @0xBA5ED: \\n \\nI\u2019ll give a quick refresher on what veBanny is for, as I don\u2019t know if everyone here has heard about or seen it before. So, veBanny is a way to make sure everyone who\u2019s voting in the governance is focused on the long term instead of the short term. It\u2019s a way to lock your tokens, the longer duration you lock for, the more voting power you\u2019ll get. When you do that, you\u2019ll get veBanny NFT to represent your locked tokens. \\n\\n(Screen sharing of demo starts)\\n\\nIn the future you don\u2019t have to receive the ERC-20 to lock your position. And it allows the public to extend the lock.\\n\\n@filipv: Can you explain very quickly what a public extension is?\\n\\n@jango: By default, once you\u2019ve created a lock, then it\u2019ll linearly decrease when time ticks on. Let\u2019s say you lock it for 100 days, tomorrow the lock will be 99 days. So to get the full voting power, which is a function of how many days between now and the end of the lock, you\u2019ll want to extend the lock back to 100 days, which is a transaction that needs gas. But sometimes if you have someone to be able to go in and send that transaction to extend your lock, you can set that flag to True. \\n\\nIf you intend to keep a locked position, maybe you have a voting habit, or someone who can easily afford that transaction can go in and extend it for you. Or if you don\u2019t choose that, we\u2019ll have control over it so you can inch toward liquidity of your position at the rate that you choose. That thing was added as a result of discussion when this was being designed, that a lot of people want to keep their voting power full, but they might not want to be sending transactions regularly and this is precautionary. I don\u2019t know at what frequency people will want to send that extension transaction on their own, but it was a quick flag to add that didn\u2019t open up a lot of weird complexity, so we put it there.\\n\\n@filipv: Is that something that can be reconfigured? Can I send a transaction to turn off the public extension on a position that I already have?\\n\\n@jango: The owner can change that whenever.\\n\\n@0xBA5ED: So here it is, I own it(finished locking position). So I\u2019m going to take a pretty big risk right now because I haven\u2019t tested this on the testnet yet. Because the minimum duration is a week to lock, so I made one veBanny a week ago. Just one, so I haven\u2019t tested it yet. We\u2019re going to redeem it, we\u2019re going to unlock our tokens and redeem them for ETH from the overflow in one transaction. So let\u2019s see.\\n\\n@jango: This is another cool feature of the ve mechanism that is different from the traditional Curve ve mechanism on which this is based. Since Juicebox has redeem functionality, you can redeem your treasury tokens for the underlying treasury asset. At any point you can still redeem your locked position for the underlying treasury assets, independent of whether it\'s locked or not. So you can have your tokens locked for a year, you\u2019ll be able to get your JBX back until the year\u2019s up. But you can burn your NFT to get your JBX to get the underlying treasury asset whenever.\\n\\n@0xBA5ED: Exactly. So before I burn it, I thought that we just show the voting power actually decreasing. So this is my current voting power and every block that passes it\u2019ll decrease. So this decreases linearly until all my NFTs expire, then I won\u2019t have any voting power left.\\n\\n@filipv: So is voting a function of block number, or a function of time and it\u2019s just updating on block numbers?\\n\\n@0xBA5ED: It\u2019s a function of time operating on block numbers.  (redeeming\u2026) So here it\u2019s gone already. As you can see I burned the NFT which also burned the JBX that was locked and I got the ETH from  the overflow. I\u2019m very happy that it works, actually I haven\u2019t tested it yet. I know it was going to work, but still it\u2019s a bit scary to do a demo live for the 1st time.\\n\\n@Felixander: A quick question in what jango was talking about, but let\u2019s say somebody buys an NFT and they lock 100 days, and on day 75 they want to get out and they burn everything. So you can burn the NFT and the JBX. If they went in let\u2019s say for 100 dollars, then on day 75 if they burn everything they are not gonna get 100 dollars back right? Is that gonna depend on the value of JBX or how does that work?\\n\\n@jango: They\u2019ll be able to, all the underlying JBX are gonna be redeemed with the exact same function that the treasury normally redeems at. That doesn\u2019t decrease linearly. The idea is probably the value of the JBX or the NFT, it\u2019s literally the floor, so you might find more value in NFY by selling it on the market.\\n\\nBut the point of doing this is because they were functionalities actually fairly meaningful in the Juicebox ecosystem since we\u2019re minting JBX open-endedly. So someone can come in right now and put in like 6m dollars worth of ETH and they basically get 50% of the JBX supply or whatever. If they weren\u2019t trying to coordinate with the rest of us, they could take everyone\u2019s assets then basically use that big pool of JBX to control whatever was there before. The point of redeeming is that if somebody does that in a way that\u2019s not trying to integrate with the current system, then anyone who currently has JBX is basically getting a shit ton of money from this person who comes in, so anyone who doesn\u2019t want to be a part of that ecosystem can redeem basically and leave with a big chunk of what was just poured in. So this is in a way to disincentivize this takeover thing. So we need to keep that mechanism in place regardless of if JBX is locked because if we lock it and don\u2019t keep that mechanism in place, that vulnerability becomes larger. \\n\\n@Felixander: One more question for the NFT profile page. Are we making a difference between different Bannies, obviously they have different histories and stats, or are we putting that in the NFT profile page or is it gonna be the same page and the info exists somewhere else on a website or something?\\n\\n@tankbottoms: The thinking was just keep the metadata inside the veBanny strictly about Juicebox with the exception of the name of the character, the model and the description will be added as well as these characteristics, shadowness etc. Everything in the metadata for the token will be related to Juicebox and will speak about Juicebox. There\u2019s a location where we could put a URL in the description in the external URL so that in the opensea UI when you go to a detail page you can jump to it. The thinking was to keep it specified to Juicebox. With that said, there\u2019s something you can do when you load up a web page with CSS and Javascript. I am trying to do some animation with the token, so when you go to a detail page, we could put a hidden link in that people can click to jump to Bannyverse.\\n\\n@Felixander: So the metadata will be the same except for the name? Or will the description model also be different?\\n\\n@tankbottoms: All tokens will be unique to the lock duration. There\u2019s 300 tokens of each range, e.g. 0-99, 100-199, up until 100m and there are five locked positions for each token. Those 300 will have metadata that says who the character is, what the duration lock is, their motto and their history. The name of the token will be the name of the character.\\n\\n\\n ## 3. veBanny Front End by @Jmill:\\n\\n (demo undergoing\u2026\u2026)\\n\\nWe have a deployment of this to Rinkeby now. I\u2019m working on a contract reader actually populating those with real user data and then working on the transactions after that. The goal right now is to spend the next few days working on the contract reader transactions populating with real data and just moving the component around to where they need to go in the application and getting the front end of this at the door. \\n\\n@mieos: I think this looks pretty great in this little side panel. I was skeptical about it, if we\u2019re thinking how projects could launch a toggle over to set a locked voting token option and this sort of pops up in the UI of their project. Maybe it\u2019s a lot of info and there\u2019ll need to be a lot of education that goes with their community, but it\u2019s great that it can all happen right here. For what it\u2019s worth, I think it looks pretty good. Maybe it\u2019s because I understand it, but it looks nice to see it in action.\\n\\n@Jmill: I do agree with that because the flow for almost everything project management related is that it never takes you to a new screen entirely. Any other configuration you\u2019re doing is out of the drawer or model, so you know that we can keep that paradigm for this also. I think it\u2019s good that the actual controls of it are quite simple. If the user has 10 positions, there\u2019s a good way to show that here without making them scroll forever.\\n\\n@jango: We\u2019re also getting rid of the delegates onchain in this contract, which might allow us to really get rid of it from the UI as well and we\u2019re managing the delegates via other means like Snapshot and potentially to other stuff.\\n\\n@mieos: I guess I missed that bit. I think that\u2019s great, certainly simplifies the experience of a person who doesn\'t need to learn what it means to delegate or take part in that same moment.\\n\\n@jango: At this point, I think there\u2019s still some research work for filipv on the best means. The Snapshot delegation strategy seems compelling, and there\u2019s other schemas we\u2019re thinking about. I think the goal of all this stuff long term is to get rid of the multisig. To get rid of the multisig we have to do some kind of on chain voting, and on chain voting can be expensive, so we have this delegation. I think there\u2019s some creative ways we\u2019ve been bubbling up in several veBanny related threads that seem really promising. The delegate stuff was a blocker for this to the voting weight stuff. I\u2019m pretty confident that we can get rid of it from the design scope for the front end for the time being, we\u2019ll work it back in later.\\n\\n@Jmill: Just from a user\u2019s standpoint, it\u2019s a really touchy issue of how you open up this delegate picker and how do you decide what to show, which delegate option to show to the user. There wasn\u2019t a really great answer there as far as implementing that in the rest of the UI. I\u2019m just working from the mocks but it\u2019s pretty easy to remove the delegate stuff.\\n\\n@filipv: ENS sorted alphabetically and free delegate. One thing I should add about Snapshot delegation. There\u2019re hybrid solutions you can do using safe snap to have on chain execution, but you still need off chain queuing, so I\u2019m not confident in Snapshot delegation as a strategy long term on chain governance. It\u2019s good for hybridized stuff and getting close to there, but ultimately there does need to be some form of delegation if we want to be fully on chain. But I imagine there\u2019s other layers we can think about. \\n\\n@jango: Yeah, the disposable token strategy (see [here](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/961007548553637970/974046109615931432)) is very compelling to me. For now this project has a lot of merit and we still can lean on the same points of vulnerabilities that currently we are at. We\u2019re having a multisig, having an on chain voting which seem fine tradeoffs for the time being as we work towards to study our future.\\n\\nIf we can eventually have these as soon as people start having these Banny characters representing their position in governance then we\u2019re going to see these characters everywhere because it\u2019s kind of like an identity in the community. So as you start voting on Snapshot, we can also roll out interfaces and take inspiration for the work that folks at NounsDAO are doing to kind of participate with your Banny and lean in to the stuff WAGMI is doing to extend that even further.\\n\\n@mieos: I just love the idea of getting the Bannyverse and these veBanny off the ground, but I can\u2019t wait till the next DAO actually just uses the same implementation of voting and either uses WAGMI or somebody else to create these stake tokens. I\u2019m excited about this rolling out to other Juicebox projects and creating value from.\\n\\n\\n ## 4. Product Roadmap by @aeolian: \\n\\n@jango: The veBanny stuff is great but we can\u2019t ship it yet because we don\u2019t have V2 tokens up yet. And all the stuff that\u2019s up depends on the V2 JBX being out. So we\u2019re in a transition period of V1-V2. We\u2019ve got to transition the V1 JBX to V2 JBX, and we\u2019re currently talking about a few designs to do it. Coming off product roadmap discussion we\u2019ve been having in the strategy channel, we are gonna focus on making sure folks have an easy way to pay their V1 JBX to the treasury and get their V2 tokens in return, and making it easy for other projects like SharkDAO for instance, to do the same. That way we can get a lot of V1 projects who are still using their treasuries in earnest onto V2 and then build these new features on there their folks can use. So I think that\u2019s the area of focus for the time being and there\'s a couple of ways to go about it. Aeolian do you want to hit up the current thought process?\\n\\n@Aeolian: Totally. Quickly from Peel\u2019s perspective and the front end perspective, as jango has said, the immediate focus is getting this V1-V2 migration flow done, designed and implemented. There\u2019s a few different ways to go about it and jango said some good ideas in the strategy channel which everyone can check out. That\u2019s our immediate priority. So Peel is going to return to development life cycle which is going to basically in line with Juicebox funding cycle, we\'re currently on FC#22, and the work we get loosely scheduled, everyone can check out here on our Github project.\\n\\nThere are 3 main things we\u2019ve been working on:\\nV1-V2 migration flow,\\ncoming up with solution for handles for V2 projects which includes cool crossover with ENS names,\\nsome iterations on payout splits UX that making that a little more intuitive which is pretty exciting as well.\\n\\nWe will be focused on these for the next 2 weeks to one month, ironing out little bugs that have come up in V2 and refining experience alongside these big features.\\n\\nAnd beyond that, we had really good discussions in the strategy channel. Definitely encourage everyone to come hang out there and drop ideas.\\n\\nI think the overarching alignment is to figure out how to get more activities on the network and more long term oriented activities. I still think there\u2019s a few obvious things that we can build initially that have surfaced, and one of those is the multi token payment terminal stuff. \\n\\n\u201cRoadmap is coming together in a loose way\u201d.\\n\\n@jango: Everything is great. It\u2019s occurring to me that finding the transition between projects is fairly meaningful to right patterns or timeing or whatnot. It\u2019s sometimes not just a matter of feature itself but where it fits compared to other things.\\n\\nSo all these little motivations can all play into the roadmap in an interesting way that certainly takes the high level metrics we care about into account. So it\u2019s absolutely a luxury to have 4 or 5 really delicious projects on the finish line right now. But figuring out a way to actually take them through the finish line in a way that makes cohesive sense is gonna be a lot of fun and can take a lot of patience from a lot of folks who have been working on each of these projects. But I think many of them don\u2019t really have and might find themselve wanting something if we don\u2019t do another piece beforehand. If we try to do them all at the same time, it\u2019s probably gonna be like everything somewhat half baked. We\u2019ll revisit this discussion probably for 15-20mins in every Town Hall to give updates on where we are at.\\n\\nI think this line of thinking at least makes cohesive sense from our current standpoint, but can always change over time.\\n\\n ## 5. NFT Framework by @tankbottoms.eth: \\n\\n(demo undergoing\u2026\u2026)\\n\\nI\u2019m thinking maybe anybody can make the NFT and associate it with a project. But in the recent discussions, originally any NFT that came out of this system is tied to a project, but there\u2019s a bunch of feedback with a basic point that lets people do just whatever they want to do. I\u2019m really looking forward to Aeolian\'s splits. The idea is making an NFT as a project owner or as a project contributor for a project to sell on the market place of Juicebox. There are everyone\u2019s ideas to roll into advanced mode or simple mode. There can be instructions on image NFT, music/video NFT, and p5.js. \\n\\nAs you can see, it\u2019s just a lot of stuff. If you want to learn what to do, you can go to the create mode, and basically go through a PFP, or p5js or music, then create your collection to redefine your asset, review and deploy it and then price it and attach it to a project.\\n\\n@mieos: Where would a Juicebox project contributor who wants to send some money to a project go? Where would they go to purchase this NFT? How would that look?\\n\\n@tankbottoms: For things that need to be minted, this area where you can contribute could be a tab where you can mint an NFT. There\u2019s also the idea that makes a kind of landing page for a mint, then there\u2019s also the idea to have a Juicebox marketplace like Jango did. There\u2019s definitely more experimentation where it\u2019s gonna leave. The core ideas are making this tool pretty fancy and giving projects the continuous reasons to get ETH going into the treasury. They don\u2019t have to worry about the whole split thing at some point after they do their NFT thing, like how much you want to go to the treasury or go to your wallet. I think that would be super useful.\\n\\n@mieos: I think the NFT capacity inside juicebox is gonna add a lot of functionalities for projects and sort of just simplify this heady shit for staking projects. And it\u2019s just a lot and I think it just helps democratize getting contributors in the door and checking the boxes that make sure their project is strong and has all the utility. \\n\\n@tankbottoms: I hope so. I mean I don\u2019t wanna work on stuff after this ever again, just put in everything I know how that you can milk out of an NFT and the tool to simplify it. I think in advanced mode or simple mode, everything will have a lot of feedback in terms of how it actually gets implemented.\\n\\n@mieos: I\u2019m curious, Nicholas, do you have thoughts about this? You\u2019ve seen a lot of projects roll out with NFT. Does this strike any chords inside you?\\n\\n@jango: This is definitely a big thesis on how the community can derive more cash flow. But it\u2019s kind of a self-contained project for the time being, for sure it will make its way to product, once a lot of these granular things get knocked out in the next several months. I think this project could certainly have life on its own, maybe on its own site for experimentation to start. I feel very confident about the product per se and it\u2019ll be unfolded in due time. \\n\\n@nicholas: That was really what I wanted to say. It\u2019s so powerful and has so many tools in what you build. You\u2019ve created all-in-the-best class creation tools in one tool. I know you\u2019ve got ideas about on chain also, so it\u2019s even like tools that barely exist and are separated from multiple products. If you are a generative artist, there\u2019s a couple of things out there that you can use. There\u2019s a few artblock clones, then there\u2019s a manifold that has something, there are private companies that can work with you, is it good enough to be in direct competition with those things like a choice on people\u2019s mind? Or is it like I want to do a Juicebox project and I want to fund it with NFT? I think the truth is probably it can do all of those things. I think probably just have it on its own site, as it\u2019s going to be difficult to integrate elegantly. I want to think more about what interfaces make sense for it.\\n\\n@filipv: I wonder, looking at this demo and the demo by Jmill earlier, if it makes sense to start implementing some form of project page customization for project creators where project creators say if they want to put NFT market interface on their project page can switch on something in the metadata and then can configure what they want to show on their pages?\\n\\n@jango: If you look at the screenshots shared(below), I am very interested in the same idea. And I wonder if it\u2019s gonna be self-contained in the idea of a payment terminal, so maybe instead of imaging the whole site as what you can bring your payment terminal which is basically a functionality to move funds into the treasury according to some means. The customization is at least scoped to that box, this is a mock that we\u2019re still playing with ideas here.\\n\\n![](terminal.png)\\n\\n@filipv: I think this is so exciting for existing projects, I know so many projects, like SharkDAO, have spoken about doing NFT issuance on Juicebox. This is pretty crazy. I don\u2019t think anything like this exists in general and something like this could really draw people into the Juicebox ecosystem. Like Nichola said, this is a combination of all of the best. And the fact that this is in Juicebox potentially is super super crazy.\\n\\n\\n\\n## 6.

Learn about members\u2019 roles at JB and what makes them tick.*\\n\\n*0xSTVG is a JB die-hard, having been around since the early days. As the DAOs onboarder and bona fide swag and sticker monger, you can see him around the discord always helpful and ready to answer questions. Recently we had a moment to chat and I was able to hear his wonderful JB origin story, and his priorities in the JB space. Check it out below!*\\n\\n### How\u2019d you get started with JB and how has JB changed since you\u2019ve been here?\\n\\nI was in there early! I learned about DAOs through Rare Pizzas and this guy named snax\u2014 who I gotta give a shoutout to \u2018cause he\u2019s the one who introduced me to DAOs\u2014 was buying free pizzas on pizza day. It was me and him and 2 other peeps on Clubhouse, and I was like this is stupid, no way this is gonna happen. As I got more comfortable in the DAO space, I eventually found my way to SharkDAO. I had started seeing these SharkDAO logos and I figured hey, I have a printing shop, I should make some hoodies with logos on them to give away, and I did (and they were expensive!). Jango and nicholas were people who helped guide me through sending out those hoodies, and so I got to know them and got to know JB. I decided to start making some JB clothing with graphics as well, and eventually I got put together with Zeugh and the talk was about community. I started helping wherever help was needed, like with governance, moving proposals along as they were coming in, etc. Eventually filipv jumped in and we started tag-teaming it and doing the podcast, which ran for a while.\\n\\n### Filipv is great. Is it fair to call you two the gruesome twosome?\\n\\nWe worked very closely together and he ended up taking on some huge responsibilities, but we still lean on each other a lot when it comes to opinions and direction. I would definitely say I\u2019ve learned a ton from him and I think he would say the same. Every once in a while we\u2019ll pick up the phone and call each other and just say \u201cHey, how you doin\u2019?\u201d.\\n\\n### I see you as this onboarding wizard, where did that start?\\n\\nIt\u2019s definitely a roll I\u2019ve grown comfortable doing. I remember doing onboarding with MoonDAO and Slice, and eventually then for JB. It\u2019s also interesting that that sort of merged into this weird testing and feedback roll too. I found myself in the front-end chat more and more (I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m providing value there\u2013 I hope I am!) to try to test various things, launch projects on test net, find obscure bugs that are here and there and provide suggestions/feedback based on what the onboarding calls are giving me, so it\u2019s kind of become a merged roll. Being in that close proximity to the user gives a lot of great insight and perspective.\\n\\nI also think there needs to be a shield between the regular user and developers. I\u2019m very adamant that there needs to be some distance there. I\u2019ve always appreciated jango saying we\u2019re all builders at JB, but let\u2019s be honest, they\u2019re (the devs) are the builders\u2013 the developers on the JB protocol side and the Peel Team, they\u2019re really building and everyone else is providing support. Since I joined JB I\u2019ve always felt the need to kind of protect the jangos of JB because they\u2019re so hyper focused that distractions can lead to mistakes, and that can be a big problem. I think a lot of organizations should take on that approach, to be honest, to make sure those core builders are shielded from the basic questions that other contributors can answer. I feel like that\u2019s where I slid right in, I can answer those questions.\\n\\n### I\u2019m reminded of high level athletes and how they\u2019re trained. The trainer almost has to take a caretaker role, ensuring that distractions/obstacles are cleared so that the athlete can do what they do: perform.\\n\\nExactly. It\u2019s all about minimizing distraction. It\u2019s interesting that you bring up athletics; I was a former athlete and after that have been involved in high level training\u2014 olympics, NCAA athletes\u2014 and the one thing I\u2019ve carried on in my life moving into JB and other things is to eliminate distractions and be in the moment. If you are distracted about the outcome of something, you\u2019re taking away energy from the task that you\u2019re actually doing, and in athletics that could be the difference between a win and a loss, a championship and coming in second. It sounds super corny but launching new extensions has become that for me\u2013 that\u2019s the championship, we gotta get there, how do we get there, how do we stay focused are the questions I have bouncing around in my head. I\u2019ve always been an idea person\u2014 someone who can really thrive in environments where we\u2019re talking about ideas\u2014 and I\u2019ve always been good at that I felt, and JB is this crazy environment where people take ideas and build off of it into something else. It\u2019s like a dream come true.\\n\\n### There almost seems to be a hippy spirit at JB\u2013 people are just so open. I\u2019m thinking of the compensation discussion from a few weeks ago. Just an open discussion, no one at each other\u2019s throats.\\n\\nYeah, especially with a topic that\u2019s been so sensitive our whole lives\u2013 we don\u2019t talk about salary IRL, and to have this open dialogue is special. More so to have the validation that what you\u2019re providing is worth the payout that you\u2019re receiving\u2013 there\u2019s no better feeling than that. Having the support of the community has been an amazing feeling for me. People don\u2019t realize how important that is to me\u2013 to my personal being. It\u2019s quite an experience and one that I don\u2019t take for granted.\\n\\nRegarding compensation, if you don\u2019t pay the people who are irreplaceable, they\u2019re gonna go somewhere else. I think that\u2019s an important point. There\u2019s also people within the DAO that are just completely connected to the DAO itself, like if jango leaves, or Drgorilla leaves, what is JB, or Peel, or what even happens to JB?\\n\\n### Fair question.\\n\\nI\u2019ll tell ya right now\u2013 if jango decides to do another project, I would ask him if I can go with him. You just can\u2019t replace certain people. So if you don\u2019t pay them, they\u2019re gonna be gone. All that said, I do think we need to be aware that we don\u2019t have unlimited resourced. At the same time I think there\u2019s enough people in the DAO that aren\u2019t necessarily leaning on JB for all their bills/everything they do. So if there\u2019s an emergency situation where people have to back off/reduce payout, I think we\u2019ll see that happen.\\n\\n### Why the lack of assholes and mentally checked-out people at Juicebox?\\n\\nI think because everyone at JB right now has proven their value, and people who haven\u2019t don\u2019t stay around for very long; they weed themselves out. I think there\u2019s also a level of respect from each person that everybody kind of has each other\u2019s back. If you come in and try to take advantage of the DAO, I think the community can read that like a book because we all had to pay our dues. Everyone who\u2019s being paid recurring payouts has been told no at least once\u2013 that\u2019s a common denominator we all have. I think when everyone\u2019s gone through that there\u2019s a level of respect and community, which you see in how we treat each other in our day-to-day.\\n\\n### For sure! Okay switching gears: who is your favorite contributor, and why is it Zeugh?\\n\\nHaha, I think Zeugh is great\u2013 he\u2019s awesome!\\n\\nYou know, I don\u2019t know who my favorite contributor is. I\u2019ve worked closest with jango and filipv probably, but I\u2019ve gotten to know the peel team a bit more and I\u2019ve really enjoyed them asking me for feedback/allowing me to provide feedback.

Read on to learn a bit about what was discussed!\\n\\n## Product Perspective Discussion Kicks Off\\n\\nOn the heels of debuting V2, the DAO has pivoted to look forward toward future trajectories. The question of \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d was an ongoing discussion to kick off the town hall, and the overarching question of how JB will orient itself was bounced back and forth between members. One current effort is around finding and fixing all the bugs one would expect when you roll out something as wide in scope and breadth as V2, which is an ongoing endeavor the devs are focusing on, particularly as they work to build out extensions that were previously not possible with V1.\\n\\nSafe to say where JB finds itself today is quite incredible, and has etched out a presence and community known for providing an excellent tool that works and is powerfully scalable. The use cases solved for already have proven successful and powerful, and the discussion of what other future use-cases exist is ongoing. Head over to the [#strategy](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/973802723420028958) channel to learn more.\\n\\n### Delegating JBX Now Possible\\n\\nWe now have delegation on snapshot, so you can delegate your JBX to other addresses for snapshot voting. A major thank-you to DrGorilla for making this possible and putting so much effort into the cause! \\n\\nThe way it works is, for example, if you have 1 million JBX, you can delegate it to someone with 3 million JBX, and that person will have 4 million JBX voting power. But if you do choose to vote later, their vote will decrease by that same 1 million, and your vote will be as strong as your own JBX (1 million). This is a flexible way that people can share voting power without sacrificing JBX or transferring it directly to one another. To learn more check out [this link](https://vote.juicebox.money/#/delegate/jbdao.eth).\\n\\n### Twodam Joins and Rocks With Data Displays\\n\\nThe absolutely awesome twodam was able to come join us today at our town hall, and gave an awesome presentation on his new dashboard for JB. It\u2019s a powerful new dashboard with some absolutely awesome data displays, check it out [here](https://dune.com/twodam/Juicebox-Gas-and-Fun-Facts)!\\n\\n### Taking Canu to New Heights\\n\\nZeugh spoke about the role of CanuDAO to help other DAOs with marketing and community needs, and underscored the need to grow CanuDAO on par with the growth JB has seen over the past several months. The goal is for CanuDAO to provide high quality marketing and community-building services to JB, and also to affiliated and new DAOs that enter the JB space over the coming weeks.\\n\\n### Snapshot of JB in a Bear Market\\n\\nWhile the bear market has dropped the value of ETH, with continued careful treasury management the DAO has a healthy runway. There are core functions that JBers will continue to take part in and carry out, and proposals for these core areas will continue forge on. Furthermore, an excellent opportunity is within the recognition that during any downturn of the market, yield and liquidity tends to dry up in places where it was accessible before. The can serve as as silver lining for JBers. Also, a proposal to review the DAO foundation is on the books, so all members please take a look at that proposal and discuss it ahead of its snapshot vote next week.\\n\\n### Ice Cream And Banana Costumes in NYC!\\n\\nJB is considering a partnership with Morgenstern\u2019s Ice Cream parlor in NYC. The goal is that JB would deck out the ice cream shop for four days with Banny art and posters and custom ice-cream flavors and creations. JBers who network in NY ahead of the major cypto conference can point people toward the ice cream shop, meet them there to conference, and spread the good word about Juicebox. Contributor filipv will be greeting new and old members in a full-sized banana costume, and tank_bottoms is permanently banned from the event. Come enjoy the scene, more info the come!\\n\\n(For a full recording of the town hall, including the legally binding declaration filipv made to wear a banana costume for the entire 4 days, click [here](https://www.notion.so/FC-21-Town-Hall-B-7d34d29859a64fc18b4feadd70074f94).)"},{"id":"2022-05-17-town-hall","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/2022-05-17-town-hall","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2022-05-17-town-hall-summary/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-17-town-hall-summary/index.md","title":"2022-05-17 Town Hall Summary","description":"1.Product prioritization discussion @jango:","date":"2022-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"2022\u5e745\u670817\u65e5","tags":[{"label":"dao","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/dao"},{"label":"town hall","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/town-hall"},{"label":"news","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/news"}],"readingTime":14.62,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Zhape","title":"JuiceboxDAO Contributor","url":"https://twitter.com/zhape1112","imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1522548586734444544/K661H-eb_400x400.jpg","key":"zhape"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2022-05-17-town-hall","title":"2022-05-17 Town Hall Summary","authors":["zhape"],"tags":["dao","town hall","news"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Recap: JB Town Hall 5-17-2022","permalink":"/zh/blog/2022/05/17/recap-jb-town-hall"},"nextItem":{"title":"Juicebox in the Words of Zeugh","permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-in-the-words-of-zeugh"}},"content":"## 1.Product prioritization discussion @jango:\\r\\n**@jango:** \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are to some extent acknowledging the moment we find ourselves in from a product perspective, specifically juicebox.money essentially. We just got to the V2 milestone which is massive and there is natural inclination to add to what\u2019s next. We have a bunch of projects in flight, as we discussed in last Town Hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\u2019s a lot of work going on and a lot of them are closing the finish line. They are probably not going to be in production at the same time, so we\u2019ve got to figure out what our priority is and the way we think about prioritization going forward. Maybe we could just say we\u2019ll do it next week once we get it more put-together, although it is solid as it is.\\r\\n\\r\\n**@aeolian:** \\r\\n\\r\\nI think we can refine it a little bit. By next week, we probably will have a more solid plan before we actually gonna build. Yeah, we can leave it until next week.\\r\\n\\r\\n**@jango:** \\r\\n\\r\\nI think the main thing is that there\u2019s a lot of fun, powerful, shiny things in a lot of people\u2019s work, which is about to have the possibility to come into fruition. For the time being, it\u2019s quite clear what the priority is, that\u2019s risk mitigation and making sure these small bugs that naturally have found themselves in a little bit to the product via this long stretch. There\u2019s a couple of blaringly obvious pieces that the V2 has. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo in the short term, maybe a week or a few weeks, it\u2019s really coming to terms with what those are and making those as clear as possible in the UI and then giving us an avenue to peel those back as we have known extensions, because almost all of the stuff is extension related. We can create the system to disclose one at a time appropriately. And it\u2019s not a big shiny future but it\u2019s pretty important. I think top priority with these things is to keep things from going to zero, kind of our job. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2nd priority is currently straight in the dark to increase the number of projects and the volume of payments. The good news is there is plenty of work we can do right now to stitch up the risk stuff and the bug stuff as we deliberate strategy. But as that gets wrapped up, then we\u2019ll want to all be on the same page about what we\'re trying to deliver next together.\\r\\n\\r\\n**@aeolian:** \\r\\n\\r\\nI think it\u2019s worth calling attention to the fact that it\u2019s quite amazing Juicebox gets where it is. We should all have confidence at least from the UI perspective. When projects come along that kinda have the fire power, it\u2019s able to really facilitate the payments. So it\u2019s like, do we take this to the next level? What\u2019s the next level? That\u2019s really the point of the strategy channel and that document([here](https://www.notion.so/juicebox/juicebox-money-direction-b9bdac96c0f446a492ee76dee4faa4cf))and these discussions.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 2.Brief explanation about JBX delegation by @filipv: \\r\\nWe now have delegation on snapshot, so if you go to [this link](https://vote.juicebox.money/#/delegate/jbdao.eth), you can delegate your JBX to other addresses for the snapshot voting. Tks for the amazing help from @drgorilla btw. Let\u2019s say you have 1m JBX and you\u2019re delegating to someone with 3m JBX, when they vote, they\'re gonna have 4m JBX. But then if you vote after they voted, their vote will go down to their original 3m JBX, which means you still can vote on any proposal you want and they will lose your delegation, specifically on that vote. Right now this is working with both claimed and unclaimed JBX and then we\u2019ll be moving over to the veBanny when it happens.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 3.Work report by @twodam on new dashboards and protocol research:\\r\\nThere is a new Dune dashboard made by twodam in [this link](https://dune.com/twodam/Juicebox-Gas-and-Fun-Facts), in which you can find gas fee specification about setting up and managing a project in the protocol, as well as some fun facts such as \u201cprojects created per address\u201d, or \u201c how many has an ENS\u201d and so on. And he is going to do some Protocol research and comparison, current list: Mirror Parcel Superfluid Coordinape Utopia Aragon\\r\\n\\r\\n**@jango:** Just shout out for these incredibly useful analytics and there\u2019s a lot of them. Sometimes I try to find signals in these numbers. So I appreciate the readiness to take on new requests and make dashboards for things over time. It\u2019s damn helpful.\\r\\n\\r\\n**@twodam:** I have made some dashboards and maybe I need to write some reports based on these data.\\r\\n\\r\\n**@jango:** I don\u2019t know if VJ or Goldstein have worked using these dashboards but they created reports that might be based on your number, which I am actually almost certain they are. Like coming together and understanding how to distill these facts into narrative and we can use several people taking the steps like that. So yes please, I think VJ and Goldstein will keep doing that.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 4.Community and market cohesion by @Zeugh: \\r\\n It\u2019s more of informing and getting opinions here. Since last time we decided collectively how we would be improving our community through the way we manage the server and things like documentation and onboarding, we have grown a lot. It has been a good while and now we have more than 3,000 new members and lots of new contributors. For those that maybe don\u2019t know, CanuDAO, the DAO that I am paid through, is a working community here in Juicebox. \\r\\n\\r\\nLately I noticed and more people also have the feeling that in our whole marketing community, the way we communicated as a whole has not been as efficient as it could be because we don\u2019t actually have coordination between ourselves. Last week, I talked to Felixander and Casstoshi to invite them into CanuDAO too. We have this model of having a separate DAO, like WAGMI and Canu, to make decisions and work things around to actually develop it as a service to Juicebox. But as it\u2019s growing , it\u2019s getting hard to get the cohesion, so I\u2019m trying to get more people working on the community side here in Juicebox to get inside Canu too, so that we can have more specific time to talk about the Juicebox community together. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo this is to inform all of you that Felixander and Casstoshi have come in, in a way that we can communicate better like in SEO(Search Engine Optimization), pulp writing, community management. It\u2019s also an invitation for anyone that is dedicating their time in Juicebox to work community part to also join Canu, to come to our meetings where we can have more time to discuss perspectives, to discuss what we\u2019ve been seeing and ideas we\u2019ve been having in Juicebox so that we can go back and deliver better community management. I feel as the community grows and  the roles for keeping the community healthy get bigger, but Canu didn\u2019t get bigger at the same speed.  The tasks and everything expanded and Canu kept at the same size.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\u2019re about to renew our payout proposal in the next cycle, so this would be a good moment for people doing community stuff and wanting to get paid through Canu. It\u2019s more of an invitation and explanation of the reason for this invitation.\\r\\n\\r\\n**@filipv:** For someone like Matthew and Briley who have recurring payout and work directly for Juicebox, what advantages are there to work for Canu? Or are you talking more about coordination\uff1f\\r\\n\\r\\n**@Zeugh:** Not necessarily I am moving payouts to Canu, for some it makes sense, for others it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s okay to join Canu no matter if you get paid through it or not. I think it\u2019s gonna be important now that the V2 is out, and efforts in my perspective are to onboard new people and new projects, to help people coordinate and cohesion can be of great value here.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 5.Macro environment and MorganStern\u2019s Ice Cream shop event by @jango: \\r\\n### Macro:\\r\\nAs we\u2019re all aware, the treasury has decreased in dollar value quite a bit with Ethereum events in the market. It doesn\u2019t affect our day to day activity, just in a sense affects our horizon. I think what we can expect going forward, obviously we can\u2019t control what happens on a big picture scale, but running a fundraising platform does encourage us to continue to bring insights to each other over time from the perspective of how capital is being managed in macro. Looking at the runway we have, it\u2019s a good opportunity to reflect on our mission and really focus on it. I think we\u2019re at a comfortable place and we can certainly keep on for a while longer even if the access to capital affects us, which will affect all the projects on the platform and subsequently our revenue stream. Even if things were to slow down in a couple of years, we will still be comfortable in the runway\'s perspective if we manage the treasury appropriately. These are the things to keep in mind when we\u2019re thinking about prioritizing the initiative that we\u2019re trying to further.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a lot of things that are very fundamental and core to our commission statement that I think we\u2019ll have no problem continuing to further for the next long while. During any downturn of the market, it\u2019s yield and liquidity that tend to dry up while they were pretty accessible before, so we have an opportunity to recognize that we are a funding platform, there\u2019re a lot of people now that are maybe venturing somewhat into the unknown, into new opportunities and having to retreat into their fundamental convictions of what they want to do in the projects they think are important in the moment. I think really understanding the powerful projects that we can fund are not only going to be sustainable through whatever macro environment we find ourselves in, but also maybe these kinds of projects are gonna define the future market cycles or future building cycles. \\r\\n\\r\\nI\u2019ve put up a proposal to revisit the DAO Foundation document, reading through it and what we verified in the past still feels honest and great. It\u2019ll be nice to go in the upcoming governance cycle. I want to make sure we\u2019re committing ourselves and that we\u2019re willing to spend sources on that.  We feel very serious about these things and that mission statement feels very sincere. We are indeed willing to work through whatever resources we have available to accomplish these things but realizing that things could be worse and there\u2019s sacrifice that have to be made. But we also have to be in tune with the fact that this isn\u2019t a project that reads similarly to other web2 related startups. \\r\\n\\r\\nI think a lot of ways in which we use the treasury funds can be used to help projects start up and build during this time. I think these can be among the more powerful projects to emerge. Whether we do it collectively through DAO funds or we do that through individuals who are getting payout from the DAO in recognition of their work, is still up in the air. It\u2019s way easier to support individuals as we have been doing it in the unit of ETH sent out per unit of dollar denominated payout, which is greater now for theoretically each of us are getting payout have more ETH overtime. It\u2019s totally up to you what you\u2019ll do with that, but it\u2019s an opportunity to recognize here our job isn\u2019t necessarily cut. It is just to recognize what our roles here are, looking for one building and we\u2019re the ones helping (recording lost for a while)\\r\\n\\r\\n**@mieos:** Do you think it\u2019s worth revisiting the redemption rate? If capital preservation is the thing the DAO is interested in, maybe retching that up just to touch might be useful and disincentivizing. We\u2019ve probably gone through a bulk of the redemption, and I think it might be worth revisiting it but curious what other people think.\\r\\n\\r\\n**@jango:** That\u2019s the obvious one. Thanks for bringing that up. That\u2019s an easy one to do on the surface to help protect funds, though it kinda lowers the floor price which is held up great. That mechanism is one of the standouts of the current JBX implementations and we can definitely use it here.\\r\\n\\r\\n**@mieos:** I think it\u2019s also worth mentioning just as a bit of anti-fud that the general theme during bear market cycles that if we\u2019re going to see one like the rest of crypto history has laid out, which I am skeptical of, is a great time to build and thankfully we\u2019re building a piece of software as a tool for people who are trying to build. \\r\\n\\r\\n**@jango:** I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. I think it\u2019s probable that the next while the market is continuing its current trend, we\u2019ll see a lot less campaigns to purchase things at very high valuations, like a 50m constitution. But we\u2019ll also see a lot of projects that are building long-term concepts, and I think that has been our thesis for a while now that the spotlight has been on the high raisers which make the project that\u2019s earning 5ETH or 10ETH seem insignificant. But I think it\u2019s those projects building things that last in business model that are going to shine through, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be thousands of ETH for these projects either. I wrote somewhere in the chat today, I think it makes a lot of sense that I bring it up here again. I encourage each of us to find 1, 2, 3, 4 projects around over time, led by people you particularly believe in or come to believe in, and add yourself in that project, and really figure out what they need to be successful. They probably come out from one perspective and maybe lack the resources, information or technology to do other parts of the project. We don\u2019t need to do all in the same project, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see each other around in all kinds of Discords helping things come into fruition. I think being hands-on and patient is going to pay off.\\r\\n\\r\\n**@filipv:** I think,  if anything, this could galvanize us further into building out both tooling, storytelling and communication in such a way that really emphasizes Juicebox\u2019s capability for long term treasury management for treasuries that evolve. \\r\\n\\r\\n**@mieos:** I think it\u2019s probably the best time in history for the best part of crypto to grow and become valuable, and the worst part of crypto to kinda slowly back into the shadows a little bit. That was a really loud bull market with a lot of madness, which certainly is not the reason why I\u2019m here. I\u2019m excited to build out some of the promises that the Ethereum has to offer.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Morganstern\u2019s Ice Cream shop event during NFT NYC:\\r\\n**@kenbot-studiodao:** Morganstern\u2019s Ice cream is in downtown on the low east side. It\u2019s always featured in all kinds of TV series, like Billions, and a totally iconic destination in downtown NY. He makes all kinds of flavors of ice creams, and he wants to make some custom flavors for the promotion so there would be some Juicebox oriented banana flavor that we can have some conversation with. At the same time last year, it was something like a prototype that if you have a token, you can get access to secret sandwiches not on the menu. This year, he\u2019s going to do a burger pop-up with an incredible burger chef who\u2019s nationally famous. So this would be like tagging along and building something for Juicebox where we can onboard people in real time in a special session of the shop he would hold for us.\\r\\n\\r\\n**@jango:** \\r\\n\\r\\nNFT NYC is a Monday - Thursday event, so we\u2019ll block off a chunk of time from around noon till 6pm, which is the prime time for people in NYC to stop by and have ice creams and burgers. We could basically deck out the place in Banny, like you got Banny plastered in different places, you got ice cream flavors that Juicebox and Banny related. We can invite and meet up with folks whoever is in town.\\r\\nFolks can stop by, and like Kenny said they have some criteria like onchain criteria of contributing to JuiceboxDAO or having JBX or being part of the project or whatever we decide, if we ship the veBanny in time, it should be veBanny locked position or whatever. You can get your ice cream on the house and we essentially have conversations like explaining what Juicebox is or talking to project owners. Eventually we can go through the onboarding thing. We can invite project creators to talk throughout the week who may have expressed interest in starting a Juicebox project, or transitioning an ongoing project onto Juicebox. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\u2019s like piggybacking what Morganstern\u2019s is already doing as well as the NFTNYC and trying to flex our capability for Banny and Juicebox material into a hyper specific location, and meanwhile make it all about project creators. \\r\\nThe approximate budget would be around 10k for the week perhaps including free ice creams.\\r\\nThe DAONYC event by DAOplanet is on June 24 -25, right after the NFTNYC, so we might try to make the two events work together in some way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## 7.Quizz time: \\r\\nIn the statements below, two are true, one is a lie.

Read on to learn a bit more about this sarcastic human teddy bear.*\\n\\n### How\'d you get started with JB, and how has it changed since you\'ve been here?\\n\\nI started at JB around Aug/June 2021. DAOs amazed me and i had my eyes on crypto for a while\u2026 but when I found out DAOs existed I was very excited to work with them. I joined a discord server and got involved with Tiles DAO, and eventually just explored more. I wasn\u2019t in JB way at the beginning, but I did join in the first week after release. When the question came up that a community manager was needed, I put my name out there. I had never been a comm manager per se, but had been doing comm management for other products I was helping release and so I figured I\u2019d take it on, got voted in, and hit the ground running. I started\\n\\n### So you\u2019re an OG.\\n\\nI joined in week 1 of JB, back at FC1. Although regarding crypto as a whole, I\u2019m pretty much a newbie. JB was the first project I really got involved in and put my hands on.\\n\\n### Wow, that\u2019s nuts\u2014 you\u2019ve seen the evolution of JB from start to right now. Would you say it\u2019s unrecognizable?\\n\\nFrom the beginning? I wouldn\u2019t say unrecognizable because I think some of the core values of transparency, building out in the open, and great vibes have been around since day one. The core values have not changed, and that\u2019s beautiful.\\n\\nI think of it like a sapling and tree, just as they are different, they are also the same.\\n\\n### How would you describe your role at JB?\\n\\nA confusing one, firstly, but also a very interesting one. Rarely are two days the same. There is a lot of time spent online in chats and severs, whether the Chinese chats to try to understand community issues, or in other servers to learn new tools they\u2019re using, practices they have, and how they engage/reward/manage a sustainable growth.\\n\\nLately we\u2019ve pushed hard on trying to automate governance with guys like filipv, Phytann, jigglyjamz, lazervike and others, and Canu has been heavily involved in this as well.\\n\\n### What has it been like working with the Chinese community, and their role at JB?\\n\\nIt\u2019s one of the better things that happened to JB ever, but at the same time definitely one of the biggest challenges. Bringing our Chinese members together in a governance process where we all get the power to decide what we do is a complex thing, but it\u2019s exactly what makes us so critical and diverse in what we build. We have to do good stuff\u2013 not sensibly good to my taste or American or European tastes, or to Chinese tastes, but it has to be good stuff across the board. That\u2019s very challenging to pull off, but at the same time we\u2019re all a part of the community.\\n\\nWhen the community first came, I remember I would jump in there with google translate to try to make sense of the chats going on in discord. Man, it was so suddenly so many new members, and we had to try to reach out and make those connections. It was an exiting and also exhausting time, especially since google translate can only do so much. I do have to say one of the members who has been a killer and God in moderating the Chinese community, getting them informed and engaged, is twodam. That guy is a beast and I appreciate him so much.\\n\\n### The idea of you sitting in Discord with google translate and trying to understand Chinese is absolutely hilarious to me.\\n\\nLet me tell you\u2014 now we have the translate bot. It automatically translates. But that day when we got that huge influx of members, it was 3am and my phone starting beeping, beeping, beeping, and I was like ok, silent mode, I\u2019m not working tonight, this is my one night off.\\n\\nBut it didn\u2019t stop! So I got back to my comp and there were more than 1k new members, all of them Mandarin speakers, and all were over every channel\u2013 and up to that day we didn\u2019t have a single Mandarin channel, so I spent the whole night with google translate writing FAQs, basic guides on how to solve the most common questions, translated hundreds of Q\u2019s and ranked them with what were the most relevant answers, and I think it was nicholas and someone else who was in the twitter spaces that joined and were able to pitch in and help. Shout out to those guys and everyone who helped early on with that, it was such a huge task and everyone stepped up. Eventually we even found some university students from the US that we knew who were Chinese and we asked them to translate asap, and that helped a lot too. Now we have really amazing translator teams, the of course the amazing twodam who kills it every day, and so we\u2019ve found a good stride.\\n\\nTwodam is amazing, I can\u2019t say enough good things. He ended up in this position of managing the greatest share of governance (by population) and is doing it incredibly well. I\u2019m about convinced that twdam is a team\u2013 not a guy, a whole team\u2013 because the guy does contracts, community, translates, I mean he\u2019s absolutely incredible.\\n\\n### Where are all the assholes at JB?\\n\\nThat\u2019s a very good question, actually. The main thing on that that fascinates me is that I\u2019ve spent countless hours crunching analytics data on our conversations, running our bots, and so far I haven\u2019t found them either. Idk why, but they are just not around I guess. The funny thing is we\u2019re in the crypto space\u2014 people being obnoxious is like breakfast, but somehow at JB we don\u2019t attract these kinds of people.\\n\\n### What\u2019s something somebody would be surprised to learn about you?\\n\\nI was a comp sci undergrad for 3 years, that\u2019s when I first heard about crypto, and even so it took me 5 years to ever engage in my first transaction (which was in bitcoin!) to actually get into crypto because I was completely against burning the amazon. I was a very critical person of crypto for a good while. I was misinformed.\\n\\nI get addicted to hobbies; 2 years ago I was living in a small house in the middle of the woods. I spent about one year living there, talking to my cats or the monkeys who would come to try to steal my food. I was developing digital products and tending to the gardens since I love gardening. I loved the nature, the no-plastic environment, just me and plants, no eating meat. That passed now, I\u2019m back to the animal eating part of life and living around big buildings and concrete and using plastic bags, but that was definitely a life-changing part of my last few years.\\n\\n### So what changed? The amazon can just burn to the ground?\\n\\nI stopped listening to the news and started reading some articles.\xa0 After you read the numbers/data you understand that that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. I was living in the middle of nature trying to find out how possible it was for someone living in society to have the smallest impact in nature\u2013 that was the goal of going there\u2013 to see how simple/non-violent towards nature I could live without leaving behind civilization and a modern world. I started reading everything I could in every area, so I learned a huge amount and cleared up a lot of misconceptions.\\n\\n### Fascinating. Who\u2019s your fav contributor, and why is it Zom_Bae?\\n\\nHaha. I think this gets me into a tight spot here. Although Zom_Bae is terrific, I don\u2019t think I can give her the prize without sharing it with filipv and twodam. I will not even include jango in this one just because that is obvious.\\n\\nI can\u2019t choose man, I have the blessing of a very amazing team to work with. If I had to pick, I would share my favorite contributor in four people\u2013 Filip, Jango, Twodam, and Zom_Bae. If I had to pick one, I\u2019d go with Zom_Bae. She\u2019s amazing. And the red rocket banny pfp! Zom_Bae does wonders in lots of micro areas around JB community - I would not trust anyone more than her nowadays to be the one who receives and onboards both partners and community members, contributor-wannabes, and everyone in between who needs guidance to navigate our complex environment.\\n\\njango has always been a steward for good culture, has always been bringing some perspectives of open criticism/honest debate since the beginning.\\n\\nFilip is a monster\u2013 a complete gigabrain going from governance to some automation here and there and finding good minds to help every single area he touches\u2013 there\u2019s not an issue I don\u2019t se him going around. Twodam I\u2019ve talked about more than anyone in this inteveriew\u2013 it\u2019s well deserved. Bridging two different communities while also building data queries to better observe community trends, and making it look effortless, it\u2019s just amazing\u2026\\n\\nBut then there\u2019s Mieos and Sage with WAGMI studios and all the vibes\u2013 Sage is definitely underrated! A huge shout-out to her and the vibes that we get from Banny and that we get from all the juicy fruits that she brings to life with her art. Banny\u2019s something else.\\n\\nNicholas, filipv, unicorn and 0xSTVG are fucking rocking it, doing amazing at governance issues, really taking the helm on things.\\n\\n### And how about that awesome guy who writes the Banny histories, huh?\\n\\nBut he\u2019s just in the house, I mean he\u2019s around here and there... I\u2019ll mention him maybe in the next one. Haha.\\n\\n### Okay, no hard feelings. Besides feeding wild monkeys do you have any other interesting hobbies?\\n\\nI roller blade; I\u2019m not especially good in most tricks, but I can do some tricks, some downhill stuff, but by no means an expert in any of those.\\n\\n### This is starting to go like a job interview, so I\u2019m just gonna go in hard. What\u2019s your greatest weakness?\\n\\nMy total lack of concentration. I am the apex of ADHD in a human being. That\u2019s why I tend to work in the night because everyone else is sleeping and that\u2019s less things to get distracted with. I\u2019m kind of a workaholic; I engage a good part of my hobbies like they\u2019re work. I played (semi-professionaly) League of Legends for a while. Very low-tier stuff though.\\n\\nI love gardening. I used to have an ant farm; I would catch ant queens in mating season and I started my own ant farm. I raised some ants.\\n\\nMy hobby is changing hobbies\u2013 I have 3-month sprints where I have hyper-focus in something, study a lot and research a lot, get super nerdy, and then I move on to the next thing. I\u2019ve been through organic chemistry\u2013 making my own hygiene products. Star wars\u2013 reading all I could in the expanded universe. Wicca magic. Cocktails. Making events (very close to community management)! And more to come = )\\n\\n### That\u2019s awesome. What\u2019s the favorite thing you\u2019re looking forward to?\\n\\nI\u2019ll have to split the answer in two. The first - watching how crypto changes the world. I\u2019m gonna play a part and I want to play the best part I can. I used to say in my twitter, \u201cI am here to make sure the next big social network is not owned by a corporation, but is co-owned\u201d. I want to see the power of open data, public ledgers, collective ownership over the digital assets that currently rule over people\u2019s days most of the time, and so much more. I want to watch as that unfolds and try to play a part, and I think it will happen in a massive way.\\n\\nAs for myself, I\u2019m really really keen to creating those bridges between people building stuff and people that need stuff built. I\u2019ll be going nomad for a while and traveling to try to find a way to get a local communities to organize and find solutions through the tech they\u2019re creating. Local communities are powerful and we\u2019re finally at a point where digital communities are also hitting that kind of strength. If we can merge local and digital communities we can really change things. When the people making products, the politicians making promises, etc., are also the people who are living in a community, they can\u2019t just say they\u2019ll do things and not do them. Suddenly there is accountability, and things get better. I want to build a solar-punk future. It sounds crazy, but I used to say, \u201cI\u2019m not crazy, I\u2019m just hopeful.\u201d"},{"id":"questions-concerning-compensation","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/questions-concerning-compensation","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2022-05-11-questions-concerning-compensation.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-11-questions-concerning-compensation.md","title":"Questions Concerning Compensation","description":"As many of you may have noticed, the question of compensation has come up recently in the discord (linked here).

It was an exceptionally valuable discussion that really highlighted how tricky the question concerning compensation is, both at JB specifically and in the web3 DAO space as a whole.\\n\\nCentral to this question and perhaps a source of equivocation is this: what precisely is Juicebox?\\n\\nPeople looking at Juicebox like a startup, assuming it will exist like startups in the web2 world, may be quick to advocate for low salaries. After all, you don\u2019t want high salaries if you are looking to pump up value in a company that you want to sell. This is the case with classic startups that are seeded with VC and created with the intent of profit as their final goal.\\n\\nBut you can also look at Juicebox like a grass-roots company\u2013 still profit driven, but not looking to sell. This would be in-line with your classic examples of companies that went big\u2013 think Bill Gates dropping out of college to create Microsoft, or Mark Zuckerberg doing the same with Facebook. In these cases, the goal was not to pump value and then sell; rather, the goal was to build first, and only after that to reap the rewards down the line. When Mark Zuckerberg made facebook, Myspace was the biggest name in town. In a few short years, it became an afterthought, and Mark Zuckerberg became the reptilian overlord we know him as today. He was in it for the long-haul, and it paid off for him.\\n\\nAnd finally, you can look at Juicebox as a community. In this schema, it\u2019s a collection of people all pulling in the same direction. The people who see Juicebox this way are quick to tell you that profit doesn\u2019t really enter their minds too much, nor does a potential long-term promise of riches and private yachts. Rather, these people just like the people, the vibe, and the sense of being a part of something greater than themselves.\\n\\nAll this a long-winded way to point out that, if we ask the three people above about compensation, we\u2019re likely to get three very different answers. Furthermore, we\u2019re even more likely to equivocate the word at hand.\\n\\nFor instance: at Juicebox, are we compensating for services rendered, or are we acknowledging people\u2019s efforts *through* compensation? Are we disbursing funds based on how profit-driven companies pay their employees, or are we giving pieces of the pie, ie JBX, to stake future promise and voice into our contributors? And in either case, how are we valuing contributors based on their roles differently?\\n\\nAnd then there is a question of effort spent working\u2013 that is, is it even fair to tie compensation to how hard one works. Take for instance classic capitalist models. You may know someone who works hard and makes 50k per year. You may know someone who works hard and makes 200k a year. You may wonder if one person is truly working \u201charder\u201d than the other. Maybe so, maybe not. But then take Elon Musk, who is worth 300 billion dollars, give or take. Is it fair to say that, in comparison to our 200k-per-year example, Elon is working 1.5 million times harder? Or compared to our 50K example, that he\u2019s working six million times harder? We see from this reductio ad absurdem that equating value with how hard one works tends toward fallacy.\\n\\nAnd so we arrive back and square one. What is compensation, truly? What is fair compensation? Is comparison the thief of joy, or should we look to others to determine our own worth? Marx said: from each according to his ability, to each according to his need. An honor system in other words\u2013 I am a contributor doing X in a city where I need Y to live comfortably, and I\u2019m asking for Y. Is this the solution\u2013 a commune where wealth is shared according to what people self-report they need? It doesn\u2019t take a much to point out the room for abuse there.\\n\\nPerhaps this is the central point: complicated, worthwhile endeavors are messy. There aren\u2019t simple answers to these questions, and there shouldn\u2019t be. The fact that we\u2019re doing something worthwhile is underpinned by the fact that we\u2019re even having these conversations, and so authentically and transparently at that. Like great art, you can\u2019t expect people to come away agreeing that this discussion means the same thing, or that it\u2019s solved. But what can be said is that our attitude toward the discussion should reflect ourselves authentically, and should show our steadfast determination to working together, to community and to teamwork. Oscar Wilde said, \u201cA cynic is a man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.\u201d We should take these words to heart and resolve to never get lost in just the numbers."},{"id":"2022-05-11-town-hall","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/2022-05-11-town-hall","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2022-05-11-town-hall-summary/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-11-town-hall-summary/index.md","title":"2022-05-11 Town Hall Summary","description":"1.

Intro\\r\\n\\r\\n### 2. Front end update from @aeolian:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had another good week, and pretty much on track for a Mainnet launch in the next 3-4days. We started a feature freeze 36h ago, which means not merging anything unless it\u2019s a critical bug, none of which is found, to allow us to merge a big PR that supports a new subgraph. New subgraph is currently indexing the mainnet, now it\u2019s a waiting game that needs logical coordination to get things to happen. Once that\u2019s in, we are basically ready to launch V2 on mainnet. The good thing is, that the launch is not a one-way door, if we have major issues, we can always switch back to V1 to fix the issues and switch back to V2 after that. It has been a much bigger effort than we all imagined, but it is now coming to a close here.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 3. Quick inventory check by @jango: \\r\\n\\r\\nNot sure if it\u2019s useful but I think the past few days after V2 has been up, folks have been more future and forward looking. There\u2019s been a lot of ideas coming up that people are prototyping and playing with. Sometimes people are in tune with things happening while sometimes not. I just want to make sure that we all somewhere are aware of what\u2019s on our mind and where different projects are at.\\r\\n\\r\\n1) V2 contracts (deployed) : V2 contracts have been shared quite a few times in Town Hall. These have been deployed in the 4th iteration which is feeling great. So, our products are basically done in their initial capacity and in the needs of contracts. I just want to make sure it\u2019s communicated out enough so folks know how to use it.\\r\\n\\r\\n2) Docs (deployed, iterating): The docs are started by @filipv and a bunch of stuff has been added from a technical perspective. Those are done as well and constantly iterated on.\\r\\n@filipv: I am very excited to help centralize a lot of resources to build extensions to the protocol, and it is like a repository of information about everything related to Juicebox).\\r\\n@jango: Big shouts for helps in setting that up in the beginning and shouts for WAGMI studio, @sage and @mieos for starting to create a whole-worldly vibe for what a repository of higher knowledge could look like.\\r\\n\\r\\n3) Fee extension (formalizing): This is a solution to use V2 tooling to route incoming payments to JuiceboxDAO to best yielding places for JBX, on AMM or first party issuance mechanical. It is looking great and we are wrapping up tests and playing with optimization, kind of in a formalizing stage.\\r\\n\\r\\n4) veBanny contracts (formalizing): This is a way of staking JBX for an NFT ve position, which is locking your JBX over time to have a new kind of accounting primitive to use for governance. I hope we can align decision-making with a longer term community interest in this way. Alongside it, a lot of art is being experimented by the WAGMI team, tankbottoms and natasha. This job is also being formalized, we are trying to piece together, according to CURVE ve contracts, how we might do delegation in this scheme. It\u2019s very promising.\\r\\n\\r\\n5) V1\u2192V2 migration terminal (prototyped, formalizable): Once V2 is up, projects can have a V2 token issued if they choose to operate on V2 as well as V1, which is what JuiceboxDAO will do. We are going to prototype a terminal where the V2 treasury will accept the V1 treasury token as payment and issue its V2 version one for one (1:1). It, to some extent, works within the mental model of how Juicebox treasuries are working, and we are trying to manage the migration in that way.\\r\\n\\r\\n6) NFT market (prototyped): It is a topic that has been lingering for a while and happened in conversations quite many times and might be on the horizon. It\u2019s a set of contracts that allow folks to list NFT with the sales routed through a particular Juicebox treasury or a set of treasuries. The goal of this project is, instead of having the pay button as the way to pay projects, anyone could upload an NFT that could basically serve as the pay button. Someone could just buy the NFT and the funds would be routed to the treasury. This is in effect a more engaging pay button that is extended to do the NFT related treasury things. This is also prototyped, and it seems we also have a few prototypes from @tankbottoms as well. It still need some design iterations.\\r\\n\\r\\n7) V2 versioning fire drill (prototyping): There\u2019s an idea floating around once we get V2 up to sooner rather than later organize how versioning might work on V2, like we might deploy subsequent version of the payment terminal V2, which is a feature of V2 as hyperforkability. People can roll their treasuries and migrate between terminals. Might be interesting to be right off the bat, before some happenings or pressure, to migrate from one terminal to another slightly optimized one. This is not really a big deal but more so to get the cadence of feeling confident in how we might organize files. It\u2019s not an urgent matter, but we should think of doing it instead of waiting till things get chaotic and we\u2019re driven by necessity to migrate, by then things tend to be more delicate.\\r\\n\\r\\n8) 1:1 terminals for L2 strategy (pre-prototyping): The L2 strategy allows projects to manage treasuries on not just mainnet but any other L2, then to have their tokens organized across chains, taking redemption into account, etc. There is a good design for it, it just needs to be prototyped. \\r\\n\\r\\n9) Subscription terminal (pre-prototyping): It\u2019s not really worth touching on but @jigglyjam brought up a cool use case that might be fun to sail for.\\r\\n\\r\\n10) Juicebox reverse ENS registry (pre-prototyping):With the V2 tool box available, front end brought up a good point regarding Juicebox reverse ENS registry. In V1 we had handles for projects which is great in the short term, but it has a whole lot we need to think about for a long-term perspective. In V2, we just started with project IDs, so that people can build things on top of it. Front end has already accommodated ENS support for projects to use as URLs to access their treasury, but there\u2019s couple of things in the UI that need to be nicer if there\'s an additional Juicebox reverse ENS registry. \\r\\n\\r\\n11) Treasure hunt: \\r\\n@mieos has been working on a treasure hunt on cryptovoxels.com which is pretty exciting. \\r\\nupdates on treasure hunt by @wackozacco:\\r\\nWe are trying to experiment to coordinate something special with V2 promotion. Please go to the 3rd floor of the parcel, where there are clues for seed phrases of the treasure chest. There is already 150k JBX inside the wallet. After V2, @mieos will set up another discord to give clues for the decoder. We try to plan some more scavenger hunt type of things.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 4. Nance bot by @jigglyjams:\\r\\n\\r\\nNance bot has been up and running since the last Funding Cycle, and I am working on scheduling it now. I am definitely interested in how subscription payments tied into it for future DAOs. Nance is like automating the governance pipeline, e.g. Juicebox has a notion-discord-snapshot pipeline, this feels like their valves, and also works for other Juicebox projects using similar structure. The notion page by @filipv and @jigglyjams is [here](https://www.notion.so/juicebox/Governance-Automation-Overview-772dc68367a741fe9d96f768997a28eb)\\r\\n\\r\\nUtilizing nance bot is currently through CanuDAO, I am planning to use the subscription contract for future DAOs to pay for the use of nance bot.\\r\\n\\r\\n@jango: I am interested in taking a step in the subscription terminal, it could be an interesting project and a decent entry in building Juicebox extensions too.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 5. Podcast updates by @matthewbrooks and @brileigh\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have just posted the 1st podcast with @dropnerd from SharkDAO, currently we are editing the 2nd episode which was recorded with @drgorilla and @zhape about Moody\u2019sDAO, and working on finishing that up. I think the results are good so far, and we are open to constructive feedback.\\r\\n@jango: I suppose Moody\u2019sDAO should be another project worth mentioning here. We are trying to make everyone aware of what\u2019s happening, say it out loud the priorities, and see how to nudge each other towards bringing things over the finish line one at a time. Surely everything is making an impressive progress over the past months, some of them are really hefty projects that are not easy to spec out let alone bring it to the finish line.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 6. Presentation by @tankbottoms and @filipv \\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, this presentation talks about different objectives based on the foundation which is helping people confidently run programmable and community fund treasuries, from start to scale openly on Ethereum.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lot of people are using Juicebox so far because these are short term project instances which Juicebox is amazing for. You go to the website and in a minute you can have a treasury set up with the project\u2019s page. But a lot of projects are more oriented towards longer term development, and would want to have their own website and an interface custom suited to what they need to do. Something @aeolian brought up today is super valuable in building out different libraries of components which makes it super easy for projects like Flamingo or Muse0 to interface with the Juicebox protocol.\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of enabling people to build longer term oriented projects is to help approach legal things in a way that makes people more confident. We can add terms of use and a privacy policy for juicebox.money and other front end. And we are also working with dao-lawfirm.eth, the one @tankbottoms is working with, to set up some accessible packages for Juicebox projects and potential templates and generic policies which will hopefully help people build on Juicebox with more legal peace of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother idea is to bring in some DEFI capability by using some of the functionalities that V2 provides and we can start by doing stablecoin, overtime we can work with different services providers to set up bot terminals which people can add as a payout and then be able to interface with different DEFI protocols. If JuiceboxDAO is focused on treasury management for DAOs with long term orientation, being able to diversify and split ETH into a bunch of stuff is probably more attractive than just keeping ETH in the treasury in terms of minimizing risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother part will be genesis NFT creation. I just did the pull request for the NFT delegate. The first 100 people that contribute to your project should get an commemorative NFT or people who contribute more can get the NFT. The delegate is a new function or a feature in V2 that executes an arbitrary smart contract or basically does whatever you want whenever someone pays or redeems with a Juicebox treasury. \\r\\n\\r\\nQ: When this stuff is implemented, how much longer is it to launch a project? Are you going to have the option to not use these things by bypassing them, like, if i don\u2019t want them but just something simple, can I click a button to bypass?\\r\\n\\r\\n@filipv: I wonder if it makes sense to implement these things as an optional library or even on a separate website from the main juicebox.money interface. If you want to do NFT, you can go to the other website.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a ton of functionalities tank has been working on. Like this NFT market is to some extent extending the functionality of minting NFT which projects can use, and contributions on the market place can be sent to the DAO treasury. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe bot terminal basically creates treasuries which will interface with different DEFI protocols and we can create custom strategies to diversify assets and to manage treasury as easy as adding another payout. What\u2019s great is that there is no fee in between projects in V2. The idea is to make it sticky and make people want to build in Juicebox because it\u2019ll give them access to these tools such as NFT and DEFI stuff like that. First these are built for JuiceboxDAO, but eventually hopefully will be accessible to the entire ecosystem.\\r\\n\\r\\n@jango: We should continue to go out and prioritize and try to refactor until the right way  to present it to folks, in a way that preserves the users\u2019 focus as they are trying to find out how to set up projects and achieve certain things. I am curious how you see a lot of these new features playing in one place because a lot of mocks belong to juicebox.money or navigatable from the same UI. Maybe this is a question that we should keep in mind as a group going forward. There are going to be some competing for space in the interface, or competing for attention. \\r\\n\\r\\n@filipv: In my opinion, one super valuable work flow would be to compartmentalize all of these into APPs. we can build this library of extensions in the Juicebox protocol. If you want to use it for your project, you can click \u201cadd\u201d, and people can put in their custom contract. \\r\\n\\r\\n### 7.  On Gorilla Marketing: \\r\\n\\r\\n@filipv: I want to mention the Gorilla marketing that @Zeugh is up to. There\u2019s a lot of discussion of physical presence at conferences. I think it has a lot of potential. Anyone interested can reach out to us.\\r\\n\\r\\n@Zeugh: That\u2019s something I am excited for. I\u2019ve been talking a little more this week with @felixander and @casstoshi about joining some forces to make it better by integrating gorilla marketing, pulp writing and search optimization. I believe we are going to have some nice news soon on getting better visibility. I was reading about treasure management, talked with @twodam, @jango and @drgorilla about the runway we have in ETH. And one of the solutions I believe is to get more projects inside and make that treasury grow. So ETH goes down, treasury goes up. It makes a whole lot of sense to me that marketing, writing and visibility can play a good part in that.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 8. On user flow. \\r\\n\\r\\n@filipv: Does anybody have any thoughts on user flow, and what that would look like as these extensions are built out?\\r\\n\\r\\n@jango: I am gonna say these are gonna come together over several weeks. This will continue to be a topic in subsequent town halls. We will keep revisiting.\\r\\n\\r\\n@nicholas: I think maybe it\u2019s interesting to think the creation flow could be people coming from very different points of view. We may be having an easier time building a treasury set up for their use cases. Then maybe those are rolled into this modular interface content. \\r\\n\\r\\n### 9.

After all, comedy never pays the bills. Read on to learn a bit more about his passions, history at JB, and eclectic former jobs\u2014 one of which traces back over 500 years!*\\n\\n### How\'d you get started with JB, and how has it changed since you\'ve been here?\\n\\nIt all started in November, when nicholas reached out to tell me that JB was looking for devs. I joined immediately. I had left previous projects because they were either running in circle or became cash-grabs, so I was looking for something more interesting (for a solidity dev) to do. I joined the Discord the same day nicholas reached out and wrote my first batch of unit tests the same night!\\n\\nThis period was in-between ConstitutionDAO and AssangeDAO, so we were in some kind of a wave of newcomers to JuiceboxDAO. Since then, Juicebox and JuiceboxDAO have been maturing a lot, in terms of governance, tech, identity (and there are so many cool things yet to come) :)\\n\\n### That\'s such an awesome origin story. One thing that has struck me is how open and inclusive people are at JB; I haven\'t encountered a single asshole yet. Where are they?\\n\\n\u2026 Not in JuiceboxDAO.\\nAll in all, this is a great contributors team, and a super diverse community around, really a nice place!\\n\\n### What is something people here in JB would be surprised to learn about you?

This article recaps some of the main points discussed. Also a huge shout-out to Zhape for his excellent on-the-fly translations!\\n\\n### Translation needs\\n\\nThe translation efforts are coming back underway as JB has overhauled its documents over the past few weeks. One area of concern was in how to best achieve accurate translations that can be written engagingly. The need for accurate translators, particularly who are comfortable working from English to Chinese, was underscored by Zhape. If you are comfortable translating into Chinese fluently and would like to contribute to translation efforts, reach out to Zotico in the #translation channel.\\n\\n### Guerilla Marketing Campaign and Community Building\\n\\nZeugh gave a brief highlight of some intended efforts at marketing and community building. Currently, there have been discussions to send some Juicebox contributors to Crypto or NFT conferences where they can network and spread the word about Juicebox. Possible eventual speaking opportunities at conferences, or sponsorships of conferences, are also being discussed, but at the moment the goal is to start small and see if we can spread the word about Juicebox and make meaningful connections between communities, or create opportunities for people to open projects on the Juicebox platform.\\n\\n### Translating outreach/community content\\n\\nOne area discussed was the importance of trying to make it a priority to translate into Chinese blog posts, interviews, or other materials that will help bridge the gap between our Chinese-speaking and English-speaking communities. For instance, an article such as this one that simply updates the community at large on a recent discord call, or an article that announces major changes coming with V2, would be excellent opportunities to inform our Chinese-speaking readers and to open the opportunity to gain feedback from them.\\n\\n### The state of V2\\n\\njango gave some insights on how the V2 protocol is coming along. Front-end of the protocol is still under development and coming along nicely, and in the mean time fine-tuning measures in the back-end continue to ensure a smooth rollout. The V2 protocol will allow many creative opportunities to build extensions, and offer more tools to project creation. So far early reception has been very good.\\n\\n### Tokenomics strategies\\n\\nThe question of how tokens should be disbursed, traded and valued also came up. The goal of ensuring that a project received the best rate of JBX per ETH is being discussed and worked on. Practically, this would mean that if a better JBX rate existed from an AMM, a project creator would receive that rate JBX at the AMM exchange rate. While JBX currently has low liquidity, one line of thinking is that such a system, which would necessarily drive traffic to such AMM\u2019s, would serve as a mechanism to build those liquidity pools. Importantly, the impetus for such a process starting will likely come as Juicebox incentivizes these opportunities.\\n\\n### Voting equity\\n\\nAnother core topic of discussion was around voting equity in the current DAO governance. The question centered around how to strike a balance between early contributing members, such as jango, who have very large sums of JBX and thus have tremendous voting power, and members who may be contributing heavily but are newer, and thus have far lower voting power. This is a catch-22, but it is important to note that this imbalance is certainly aware to early contributors such as peri, jango and others. In the case of per and jango, they do not engage in voting for this reason (both were quick to point out). One solution is to continue issuing JBX, which will give more voting power to more individuals, but this also flies squarely against certain opinions to completely stop JBX issuance. It is a complex situation that has a lot of moving parts, and is inextricably linked to the JBX issuance/AMM situation mentioned above. Ultimately the thinking is that with these new changes, solutions may present themselves and we will see growth and directions in these domains.\\n\\n### Main Takeaways\\n\\nThis call provided important information and helped streamline communication between the English-speaking and Chinese-speaking Juicebox member communities. The nature of questions remained substantive throughout and finding a cadence to have such calls seems like a good strategy moving forward. A huge thank-you to our members, both English- and Chinese-speakers, for taking the time to hop on this call and for having such open and transparent discussions. And again a huge thank-you to Zhape, who translated and managed the discussion and kept a good flow going!"},{"id":"where-are-they-now-filipv","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/where-are-they-now-filipv","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2022-04-30-where-are-they-now-filipv.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-04-30-where-are-they-now-filipv.md","title":"Where Are They Now?

[ARCx](https://arcx.money/) has worked with us to collate and summarise some preliminary findings from the airdrop. Results below!\\n\\n## Definitions\\n\\nTo fully comprehend the findings, it helps to quickly define the terminology used in our analysis.\\n\\nMost of these findings centralise around a concept called the \\"Retention Rate\\". The retention rate is defined as the **lowest JBX balance for an address after the airdrop**. To better understand this, let\'s use an example:\\n\\n`0x123` claims 100 JBX tokens from the airdrop. They then go on to sell 30 of their tokens immediately after claiming. This address then waits a week, and buys back the originally sold 30 tokens. In this scenario `0x123` would have a retention rate of 70%, even after buying back the tokens, as it is the greatest amount of tokens sold after the claim.\\n\\nThis logic ensures that per address the retention rate can only go down over time.\\n\\nThe second concept to understand is the \\"Average Retention Rate\\". Many of these graphs aggregate the retention rates across all claimers in the airdrop. The average retention rate is defined as **the average of all the retention rates for all addresses whom have claimed already**. So, again using an example, if 10 addresses claimed the airdrop each day, then the average retention rate on day 1 would only consider the first 10 address and not any of the addresses who claimed on day 2, day 3, etc.\\n\\n## Findings\\n\\nThe first graph shows retention rates 28 days after several major airdrops. The Juicebox Benefits Airdrop had unprecedented levels of hodling!\\n\\n![](juicebox_retention_snapshot.png)\\n\\nThe next graph also shows retention rates, but instead shows them over time. After a brief selloff, retention was remarkably stable.\\n\\n![](juicebox_retention_over_time.png)\\n\\nNext, we consider this same retention rate over time broken down across the 3 different score chorts (see [JBP-114](https://snapshot.org/#/jbdao.eth/proposal/0xd10c56f453851063665241417642352beaf8816aca062c29f98b1f5154ff3cdd)). Interestingly, the cohort with scores between 53-200 had the second highest retention rate, beating out the 201-300 cohort by ~15% at times.\\n\\n![](juicebox_retention_by_cohort.png)\\n\\nFinally, we looked at how quickly each cohort claimed their JBX. Interestingly, the 53-200 tier fared better than the 201-300 tier in this metric as well. \\n\\n![](juicebox_claims.png)\\n\\nThank you to everybody who helped make this airdrop happen.

Learn about members\u2019 roles at JB and what makes them tick.*\\n\\n*tankbottoms is a new contributor to the JB space. He contributes to JB, Wagmi productions and MovementDAO, and is a passionate software developer with a unique handle to say the least. Read on to learn a bit about his thoughts on the Web 3 space, DAOs, and his passionate interest in furthering humanitarian causes through MovementDAO.*\\n\\n### First, the name\u2013 tankbottoms\u2013 would you mind walking me through that?\\n\\nI wanted to draw attention that there are other articles of clothing that may not get the attention that they deserve, such as tankbottoms, and so that\u2019s my contribution, fashion education.\\n\\n### How\'d you get started with JB, and what attracted you to the platform?\\n\\nI\u2019ve been around six weeks or so. I\u2019ve been in software development for a minute, and I met some anons who wanted to do this public good DAO, which is now called MovementDAO. It\u2019s part seeding start-ups, part non-profit, part social movements.  In researching platforms to work with I found two which I liked the most, OpenLaw\u2019s TributeDAO Framework and Juicebox. \\n\\nTributeDAO we updated all the tooling and added DeFi, and at the end felt it was not as accessible as we would have liked. We also took Juicebox forked it and launched it on Polygon (where Matic is used), which was more what we were looking for.  However, we are not the kind of cats to fork and do stuff, its open source and its fair game, but we contribute, add value and divide up the work, so it seemed right to contribute to helping through v2.  \\n\\nOne place it was mentioned where we could help was figure out the BannyVerse situation. I pinged Wagmi\u2019s Mieos and started collaborating with constructing Banny to be mintable, worked on the TokenUriResolver how the veBannys were going to be selected, and planning on the BannyVerse would unfold NFT-wise. \\n\\n### **That\u2019s fascinating, you seem to be well-versed on the technical side of this stuff. In your opinion, how do DAO\u2019s protect themselves from bad actors/sabotage?**\\n\\nA few DAOs have added a veto contract or function in existing contracts that can veto any pending proposals.  This can be provided to a law firm, also called service provider, or retained by the founders until they revoke the right on chain at a later date. In other words, it\u2019s designed to ensure nothing crazy happens.\\n\\n### Interesting. It seems like that mechanism kind of runs against the philosophy of what a DAO is, doesn\u2019t it? How do you strike a balance between control and decentralization?\\n\\nThat\u2019s the dichotomy\u2013 you can make a decentralized protocol that\u2019s idealistic, and it functions, but then there\u2019s the reality that people are involved, and if it has ETH, there needs to be emergency protocols in place \u2013 to guard against whether someone\u2019s gaming, a flaw in the smart contract is discovered, or some bad actors reveal themselves. This whole space is a one large expensive experiment and so you really don\u2019t know what may happen, so its safe to be prudent.\\n\\n### I always think of DAO/Crypto time similar to dog-years and aging: like one month of time in a DAO has gotta be at least 6 months or a year at a regular IRL company. You and I of course both help as contributors to Wagmi productions. How would you describe your role at JB and Wagmi after this first 6 weeks or so?\\n\\nI like to think if there is code which expands the reach of the Banny, I am enabling this. I wrote the Juicebox TokenURI Resolver for the veBanny and make sure the composite Banny and appropriate metadata are deployed on IPFS. Additionally and more importantly, when Juicebox token holders go to stake their Banny and enter the Bannyverse, I aim to enable the experience to mint a unique Banny with anything from Hattori Hanzo to AK-47. A banana has got to defend himself. \\n\\n### **I always ask about where all the assholes are, it seems like so many talented people working together should bring a clash of egos. Where are the assholes?**\\n\\nI think it starts from the OG contributors, and fortunately the OG contributors have set a tone to be inviting and respectful as well as reward contributors. I also think people who stick around are very talented, the Notion docs do a pretty good job about making it clear that you have to contribute before seeking a one-time or reoccurring payout.  All the contributors are pretty cool about their talent. And that kind of sets the atmosphere.\\n\\n### Between you and me and the rest of the internet, who\u2019s your favorite contributor, and why is it Mieos?\\n\\nI think WAGMI makes it clear you can add a lot of value even if it\u2019s not code. WAGMI\u2019s pixel ninjas, 60 Minutes style interviews, and the enabling of the BannyVerse reinforces that throughout whatever the problem, we are all here to have fun; and reminds us all to no take yourself too seriously, and that says a lot. Mieos is very humble, even though he\u2019s been around in the space for a long time and basically the OG JB whale. He\u2019s pretty rad.\\n\\n### What\u2019s a project (within or outside of JB) that you\u2019re really looking forward to in the future?\\n\\nMovementDAO, and the future of Juicebox v2 are both things that I am working on and that I am looking forward to enabling. We are all learning every day how things work and willing to change it up, but I want to understand some fundamental parts of what makes Juicebox successful not for just raising funds but to getting people to operate treasuries transparently. We (both JB v2 and MovementDAO) want to enable this with endowments, NFT businesses, start-ups, liquidity pools into a well orchestrated decentralized protocol. \\n\\n### What\u2019s something people would be surprised to learn about you?\\n\\nI don\u2019t know, hmm\u2026 I lived in a monastery!"},{"id":"humor-all-too-humor","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/humor-all-too-humor","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2022-04-20-humor-all-too-humor.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-04-20-humor-all-too-humor.md","title":"Humor, all too humor","description":"Predictions of Past and Present","date":"2022-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"2022\u5e744\u670820\u65e5","tags":[{"label":"observations","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/observations"}],"readingTime":3.985,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Felixander","title":"Community Member","url":"https://twitter.com/realfelixander","imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1509677708854239233/Bsru0Xks_400x400.jpg","key":"felixander"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"humor-all-too-humor","title":"Humor, all too humor","authors":["felixander"],"tags":["observations"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Juicebox in the Words of tankbottoms","permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-in-the-words-of-tankbottoms"},"nextItem":{"title":"Juicebox in the Words of twodam","permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-in-the-words-of-twodam"}},"content":"## *Predictions of Past and Present*\\n\\nOnce in a while it may be nice to let loose with a little silliness. So enjoy this short article on 18th century critical theory and the folly of technological prophesies.\\n\\nHistoricism, that nebulous academic term that finds itself increasingly harder to define the more you delve into it, is at play more than you may think in the ever-changing landscape of web3. A term originally coined by Friedrich Schlegel a couple centuries ago, we will define it\u2013 for the purposes of this article\u2013 simply as the idea that societies at different times in history can oftentimes lose sight of the fact that time keeps marching forward. The future, it turns out, isn\u2019t the easiest thing to predict. And the present doesn\u2019t offer up all the answers. As much as we may be tempted to feel like we\u2019ve got it all figured out, history has a bad habit of revealing the folly that belies this hubris.\\n\\nAfter all, two Romans speaking a couple thousand years ago didn\u2019t ask each other what year it was, only for one to tell the other, \u201cWe\u2019re in the year -22 BCE, dummy!\u201d\\n\\nAll this a long-winded way to say: people tend to lose sight of the future, or, to be more precise, never truly have it. Our ability to predict is pathetically unreliable as systems grow more complex. Case in point: computing power has grown exponentially, and yet we are still terrible at predicting weather. You\u2019d think with all our developments we\u2019d be able to see a massive hurricane before it forms, and yet this feat is presently considered functionally impossible.\\n\\nFor all the naysayers out there: criticism of new ideas, technologies and ways of building isn\u2019t too new after all. People have a hard time predicting what will work, but hindsight is 20/20.

Learn about members\u2019 roles at JB and what makes them tick.*\\n\\n*twodam is a long-term contributor at JB that is known for an incredible work ethic, moderating the discord server, and creating data visualizations. He also serves a unique role in bridging communication between our English and Chinese speaking communities at JB. Read on to learn about his roles as a contributor and communicator for the JB community.*\\n\\n### How did you get started with JB, and how has it changed since you\u2019ve been here?\\n\\nWhen researching ConstitutionDAO, I discovered the platform Juicebox, and joined Discord. During that time I read through the documentation and code base, because I saw a lot of people asking questions, so I spontaneously went to help answer them. It so happened that because of the popularity of ConstitutionDAO, many people joined Discord, and that number of people reached several thousand. Zeugh recognized and recommended me to be the Discord mod. After that I also made several data panels according to the needs, to better show the trends in different aspects of JB. \\n\\nSince I\u2019ve joined, JB started to have multi-language support, the governance process got better, the number of contributors increased to a dozen, a lot of things were moving forward, and everyone was smart about it.\\n\\n### That\'s awesome, it sounds like you\'re a big part of that progress. What would people be surprised to learn about you? Any interesting hobbies?\\n\\nYeah, just in time and it\'s great to work with everyone. I actually did contract development for a while before and was a full time programmer. I used to study projects from the whole and in detail\u2014 for example, studying a protocol from the front-end all the way to the contract implementation, from the documentation to the surrounding tools and from the community to the team atmosphere.\\n\\n### That\'s super cool. When you\'re not at a computer, what do you like to do to pass the time?\\n\\nRead books, hang out with friends, play billiards. I also like to read science fiction and literary fiction.\\n\\n### That\'s awesome. A lot of the Web 3 space can feel like a sci fi, to be honest.\\n\\nIn terms of exploring a lot of new directions?\\n\\n### Yeah, new directions and also I think people don\'t really know what this new space and technology will bring. How do you think Web 3 will change the world?\\n\\nIt will make UGC owned by the creator, bring innovative formats to human collaboration and keep many things decentralized on chain, which brings transparency, retains history and much more...\\n\\nAnd maybe also somehow important, there are not really regulations yet, so innovative ideas without too many limitations can thrive.\\n\\n### \u201cInnovative ideas without too many limitations\\" really strikes me as a biggie. It seems like people are willing to go out and take risks, and make themselves vulnerable. It says a lot for an environment to bring that out of people. How would you describe your role at JB?\\n\\nI work as the Discord moderator, multisig owner and specialize in Data Viz. I also do community support and alignment, and post educational materials for mainly the Chinese community. I\u2019m also actively looking for different things that I could help; recently I\u2019m writing a Juicebox weekly summary with 0xSTVG. Also our website and blog supporting multiple languages is something filip and zotico work on very hard, and I work on the Chinese translations of that.\\n\\n### That\'s awesome, and things like the weekly summaries are really important. I always wonder about the Chinese community and how the information travels between it and the rest of the community. You kind of bridge that gap from what I understand, is that accurate?\\n\\nindeed, with the help of zhape who helped a lot in communication and vibe summaries in town-hall.\\n\\n### That\'s amazing. Is it a difficult role to have? I know sometimes there are differences of opinion between the communities. How do you manage to keep the peace?\\n\\nFirst thing I would try is to understand different opinions, and then I would help to bridge them to discuss together. Sometimes it\u2019s because people have misunderstandings, I will show them where to check and explain to them the reasoning behind. Sometimes it\u2019s because the language gap, then I will help to translate and/or communicate, for example: find the real problem, let them have discussion and correct the misinterpretations if there were any.\\n\\nYeah, this role is not easy I would say, you can\u2019t make everyone happy... have to balance between a lot of things.\\n\\n### It sounds tough, but it also sounds like you are taking a really level-headed and fair approach. Okay final question-- what is the favorite part of your day?\\n\\ngetting inspiration when solving problems and getting recognition from others.\\n\\nmake me feels good and powerful."},{"id":"fc18-updates","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/fc18-updates","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2022-04-09-fc18-updates/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-04-09-fc18-updates/index.md","title":"FC#18 Updates: v2 and Beyond","description":"Juicebox v2","date":"2022-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"2022\u5e744\u67089\u65e5","tags":[{"label":"dao","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/dao"},{"label":"updates","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/updates"}],"readingTime":1.425,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"filipv","title":"JuiceboxDAO Contributor","url":"https://twitter.com/filipv_","imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1531517308103012352/VLNKDxeQ_400x400.jpg","key":"filipv"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"fc18-updates","title":"FC#18 Updates: v2 and Beyond","authors":["filipv"],"tags":["dao","updates"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Juicebox in the Words of twodam","permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-in-the-words-of-twodam"},"nextItem":{"title":"Juicebox in the Words of peri","permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-in-the-words-of-peri"}},"content":"## Juicebox v2\\n\\nJango\'s proposal to [Deploy v2](https://snapshot.org/#/jbdao.eth/proposal/0x98bba73a52fcc2f65252d769b328ab398f955c1bb43259430ff586a568b8e06e) passed by overwhelming majority.

Learn about members\u2019 roles at JB and what makes them tick.*\\n\\n*peri is one of the two OG\u2019s of JB, having created JB along with jango and worked tirelessly to streamline it, organize contributors, and deliver excellent front-end work at a breakneck pace. Along with jango he has by far the widest perspective of the JB story. Read on to learn a bit about JB\u2019s beginnings and evolution.*\\n\\n### How\'d you get started with JB, and how has it changed since you\'ve been here?\\n\\nI was kind of around building JB from day one; jango and I were working on it by ourselves for a pretty long time before we started getting some more regular teammates\u2026 I probably spent a good six months or so building the app and most of that time I was full-time dedicated to JB. I\u2019d left my other day job early on.\\n\\nThe first iteration of the JB app was fairly limited; it definitely had some shortcomings, so we figured let\u2019s just get this to a\xa0 good place and see if people enjoy it. After JB launched it took about a month or so before the project got much traction. After that\u2013 I think Sharkdao was the first project that gave it a lot of traction\u2013 we got some other front-end contributors to help out with the work that I was doing.\\n\\n### What kept you going early on, when you had to move mountains and put so much effort in. Did you and jango have a clear vision for what all that work was going to amount to?\\n\\nI think jango and I each had our own unique visions for JB\u2013 they weren\u2019t opposed in any ways, but there were definitely certain things that were driving me and important to me, and certain things important to him. Early on\u2013 really really early on\u2013 I didn\u2019t have a complete vision for how JB would exist in the world; it was more just an interesting experiment to build a web-3 app, and I wanted to get some experience working in web-3. JB is fairly complicated, so over the months we were constantly reshaping it, so the vision was changing as well. About 2-3 months before we launched I started to think about it and realized how valuable it would be to DAOs. While we were building it, DAO\u2019s were only just starting to become big. I felt like, somebody could use this not just as a business or to create a fundraiser, but can create a community of people, and that\u2019s when I felt like JB really came into its own and found itself. The beauty of jb is that it\u2019s super extensive, and can be used for all kind of things, not just DAOs.\\n\\n### What\u2019s the average day for you look like now that JB has kind of found its stride and that major early work has been done?\\n\\nIt\u2019s definitely changed a bit\u2013 in the early days after the launch, once JB went public, it didn\u2019t change a lot, but we were also getting a lot of feedback from people on what was needed and how to better streamline things. Putting a lot of these complex items into a digestible way was very hard, especially when you\u2019re so intimately familiar with these complex processes, so getting feedback from people who were seeing this for the first time was a huge help for us.\\n\\nOnce there were more full-time contributors coming in (who we formed peel with), it changed a lot. I can\u2019t say enough good things about those early contributors\u2013 I feel so blessed that they came so eager and willing to put themselves into the work. From day 1 I was pushing code to fix small bugs and also thinking of these big-picture things, so I had wanted for a while a team to be able to help out with some of that workload. It was really beautiful because it was a time of wondering how to get those people in here, and I wondered: is this what a recruiting process looks like, do I need to be advertising positions, interviewing people and so on? That whole process is not something I was very excited or eager about, so I was just like, \u201cHopefully there will be people who find the project interesting and show up to help out\u201d\u2013 and that ended up being exactly what happened! JohnnyD, Aeolian, Torvusbug, Ooyoo were some of the major early contributors and with them we kicked into high gear. The code base got cleaned up a lot and having that diversity of opinion and diversity of experience was just a huge asset. After a month or so of that we realized we had a real team here, and started feeling like a machine.\\n\\n### With growth happening so fast, is there any way to even predict what JB might look like in a couple years?\\n\\nThe speed of things is remarkable, and that\u2019s an amazing attribute of web 3. JB feels like it\u2019s going as fast as it can go, and that\u2019s a consequence of a\xa0 number of things. A big factor is that there\u2019s always public conversations and transparency, so there\u2019s very little time wasted on catching people up, so everyone is getting the info more or less in real-time at the same time. Most people spending time on this aren\u2019t clocking out at 5pm, they\u2019re working when they want to and when they feel like it, and their passion has them executing ideas very quickly, which is wild.\\n\\nTalking about 2 years from now, that feels like a lifetime; it\u2019s hard to make any predictions, but I think the main thing we\u2019ll see going forward that I can hardly even really predict\u2013 I don\u2019t know what it\u2019ll look like\u2013 but I think there\u2019ll be a lot more decentralization of the project itself. With introduction of V2 there\u2019s gonna be a lot of added flexibility, with more diverse use cases people can use JB for, and a lot of these use cases will probably end up being built around custom extensions of JB.\\n\\n### Switching gears a bit: when you meet that awkward uncle at thanksgiving we all have, and they ask you what you do, how do you explain JB and your role in it?\\n\\nHaha. To be honest I don\u2019t find myself in that situation all that often, so I don\u2019t practice very frequently, and every time I do find myself in that situation my take on it may have changed since the last time. Oftentimes, if it\u2019s someone who isn\u2019t familiar with web 3, I won\u2019t even mention JB at all because there\u2019s so many layers of abstraction to go through. But if someone\u2019s really curious, I generally start by comparing it kickstarter, and I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s the best place to start, it\u2019s just the easiest since it\u2019s a fairly similar type of mechanism people are already familiar with. So you can kinda start there as an organization that raises money, but obviously the big differences you have to jump to is issuance of tokens, what that means, the programmability of it all, the restriction on money withdrawal and to whom. That\u2019s when it starts getting really tricky to explain.\\n\\n### I\u2019m always surprised by the conspicuous lack of assholes at JB\u2013 where are they all hiding?\\n\\nHaha. I really have never thought about that. There\u2019s a lot of assholes in the world, and maybe there were 2-3 who have come through JB in the past, but I think of it by remembering this term jango said to me once, he used this expression\u2013 \u201cDAO immune system\u201d-- and it immediately clicked to me what he meant: every DAO that has a strong culture, they have an immune system, and it\u2019s an immune system to people and decisions. And the consequence of that is if there\u2019s ideas thrown out and talked about that aren\u2019t fitting with the momentum of the DAO, then it tends to be squashed. But the beautiful thing about that is that the way the JB immune system seems to work is very polite and genuine.\\n\\n### Would you call that killing with kindness?\\n\\nYeah, I definitely see a lot of that, and it\u2019s a beautiful thing. On the topic of the DAO immune system, when factions do emerge, the beautiful thing about it is that it still remains a very democratic process, and evaluations of decisions aren\'t based on what\u2019s \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d, it\u2019s rather the democratic process of voting with JBX. Also fascinating: they\u2019ve always been fairly close votes when these issues have arisen. Ideally the way the system is set up and the governance processes we have, the DAO will ultimately decide what\u2019s best one way or another, and that\u2019s entirely subjective, since there\u2019s no such thing as an objectively good or bad outcome.\\n\\n### It\u2019s interesting connecting DAO\u2019s to democracy\u2013 in democracy, we have structures to influence voting, like campaigning, super PACS, etc. Arguably the world of DAOs is too young for this\u2013 but do you see this is an eventuality of communities and factions within DAOs trying to gain control to guide DAO decision-making?\\n\\nI think we see that already. That\u2019s a necessary part of any voting process, a \u201ccampaign\u201d-- it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to look like what we think of campaigns in ordinary politics (posters, pamphlets, etc) but it already does happen, for instance when somebody creates a proposal, there\u2019s an implicit requisite for them to defend that proposal and explain why. The temperature check is designed for discourse, and those types of conversations are themselves a form of campaigning. It\u2019s the responsibility of people much more involved in JB who have a more nuanced understanding of the mechanisms to distill their opinions on responsible voting, or to fairly summarize the pros and cons of the proposal because less-active JB members aren\u2019t as familiar with the proposal.\\n\\n### Excellent point. Switching gears: who is your favorite JB contributor, and why is it filipv?\\n\\nHaha. Filip\u2019s great, I have a lot of love for filip. When I think of filip, the things that come to mind are that he\u2019s just an excellent talker, and being a good talker is not something that feels like a resume item, but it really is, it\u2019s a really truly valuable skill that\u2019s underrated. Having somebody like filip facilitate conversations like he does is super valuable. Not only is he so good at explaining things, he\u2019s also very open-minded, knowledgeable of what he knows and quick not to pretend he\u2019s knowledgeable about what he doesn\u2019t know. He\u2019s very active, and good about proposing things we may not be thinking about. The dude just seems very level-headed; I love talking to him.\\n\\nIf I had to pick a favorite that wasn\u2019t filipv\u2013 I mean you can\u2019t pick just one obviously\u2013 but the other person I really respect is aeolian, who has come in and really taken over a lot from me to be the lead front-end person on peel. And I just have so much mad respect for aeolian\u2013 not only is he a great developer, but he knows his stuff and is great at writing good code, and he\u2019s great at having conversations about these things and being open to learn, open minded, open to teach. All the times I spent working with him\u2013 I really credit a lot of the joy I get contributing to peel, to him and the rest of the peel team, because he\u2019s made work so enjoyable.\\n\\n### That\u2019s awesome. Okay, final question: do you have any huge project in the future you\u2019re particularly excited about?\\n\\nThat\u2019s hard to say. At the moment, as of about a week ago, I\u2019m spending much less time at JB. I\u2019ve contributed to JB for so long, and having a solid group of contributors like the peel team to help take on my workload has eased me up to pursue new projects. I\u2019ve wanted to do some different type of work that is\u2019t necessarily front-end code, like some solidity work, and art-projects, and so on. So I do have a lot more time to spend on other projects now, and there\u2019s another project that I\u2019m working on now\u2013 that hasn\u2019t really been announced yet\u2013 but I\u2019m looking forward to announcing it soon.\\n\\n(Note: this interview was transcribed from a discord call.)"},{"id":"juicebox-in-the-words-of-jango","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-in-the-words-of-jango","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2022-04-04-juicebox-in-the-words-of-jango.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-04-04-juicebox-in-the-words-of-jango.md","title":"Juicebox in the Words of jango","description":"\u201cJuicebox in the words of\u201d is a series that highlights JB community members in interview form.

Learn about members\u2019 roles at JB and what makes them tick.*\\n\\n*jango is one of the two OG\u2019s of JB, having created JB along with peri and worked tirelessly to streamline it, organize contributors, and deliver excellent work at a breakneck pace. Along with peri he has by far the widest perspective of the JB story and the vision that created it. Read on to learn a bit about JB\u2019s beginnings and the vision that spawned it.*\\n\\n### How\'d you get started with JB, and how has it changed since you\'ve been here?\\n\\nIt started as a seed of thought. Around 2014/2015ish, I was building this app in iOS dev world. That was back in my younger days when I loved building shit, working with friends, piecing together who\u2019s good at what, etc. We didn\u2019t have a tonne of users on the app, but we had an open slack server where several users would come hang out with the builders\\n\\nWe didn\u2019t want to think about price, business models, advertising etc. We just wanted to build, and we didn\u2019t like thinking of this structure with users on one side to pay fees, and builders on the other to create and get paid, since we felt like the folks using the app were a part of the building process as well.\\n\\nOne day I was sitting with my notebook, trying to figure out how this whole thing was going to play out, and I captured an idea floating by. If we figured out exactly how much it would cost to run this thing, including server hosting, salaries, and so on, we could come up with one number we needed to get to by the end of the month. When we realized we could enumerate exactly what those expenses were to the users, fully transparently, and tell them listen, this is what we need to get to each month for the service to run, and if we exceed this number, we\u2019re going to use that overflow to push down the price of the product\u2013 once we realized that, we just ran with the idea and that became the product. It seems like a win-win\u2013 the team gets paid, the users get a service, and if it becomes more successful, the service becomes more and more affordable, or even free.\\n\\n### That sounds like a light-bulb moment. How did it translate into your project at that time?\\n\\nSo I stopped the project to focus full time on the building out this new concept, but tried to do it all in the Web 2 world, and it was really really hard\u2013 trying to forge relationships with banking systems about a system where there\u2019s fees, maybe fee refunds if we have overflow, etc., and someone would have coordinate all these fees, refunds, and so on, it just wasn\u2019t possible to manage all that with Web 2 structures. Around that same time I was delving into crypto, learning about the blockchain, smart contracts, and then in hit me: this idea was executable, but we were totally swimming against the current trying to do it in the Web 2 space. So I hunkered down and jumped into learning everything I could about smart contracts, did some prototypes, and by that time a lot of the team was like man, I can\u2019t get dragged on another project, so I decided to kind of jump in head-first and take the lead on seeing how this would play out. I figured the moment we had something tangible, all these brilliant people who I\u2019d met and who I had the luxury to spend time with would just hop on and help give it life.\\n\\nAt this point I was working hard along with peri to get this concept built out, and we actually went a few different iterations of the name. There was \u201cthe sustainers market\u201d, back in the Web 2 world, and then eventually we called it \u201cfountain\u201d, because of how overflow from payments kind of would trickle down, and then at a certain point, I think it was peri who said, let\u2019s just call it \u201cmilk\u201d, and we got real funky with it and said fine, and so it was \u201cmilk\u201d for about five minutes, and then we decided on \u201cjuice,\u201d and that actually stuck for a while. It wasn\u2019t until like a week before launch that we felt like man, something\u2019s missing, and then somehow we came up with \u201cJuicebox,\u201d and we all felt immediately like yes, that\u2019s the one, and so we launched with that.\\n\\nIn terms of where JB is today: everyday it changes a little bit, and early on we had no idea how it would be used. I had a decent understanding of how I may use it, but seeing how it\u2019s been used has been really awesome. But who the hell knows where it\u2019s going. We learned so much along the way, and a lot of incredible badass motherfuckers started to come through and add on to it, and it\u2019s only gotten better and better because of that.\\n\\n### peri told me about the \u201cDAO immune system\u201d - a term you coined - can you explain it in a bit more detail?\\n\\nI remember that! That\u2019s a fascinating concept. People are diverse, and JB has always had an amazing team, but over the span since launch there have been some ideas that have come up and vouched for adoption or funding, or were communicated in non-productive ways, and other folks started running away from these or critiquing them heavily, the same way a body would reject a pathogen. I found that so fascinating, and wondered how that worked, since it seemed to happen all on its own.\\n\\nThe DAO is interesting, in that I see it more as a place where ideas exist and sometimes compete. I don\u2019t think people are bad for DAOs, but ideas can certainly take root and harm the operation of a DAO. The interesting thing is early on in a DAO, ideas that come up for vote are not only important short-term, but also precedent-setting. This is a double-edged sword though, because while setting precedent can kind of immunize a DAO against future bad ideas, it can also lead a DAO to try to solve new problems with old methods. All of this is still in a nascent stage, and very fragile, so it\u2019s interesting to see how it plays out, but I do think a DAO has some built-in mechanisms, certainly JB does, that kind of helps it move in positive, productive directions.\\n\\n### Speaking of how fragile all this is, how do you approach managing risk?\\n\\nA lot of the things I learned come from taking risk, and I\u2019m not a risk averse person. In this context specifically, maybe as a programmer of the contracts you tend to feel a bit more of that weight, and you can sense a community in anticipation, and a zealousness, and so just peeling toward balance in general I think is healthy. More generally, and this is something I constantly point out, is that we need to keep the focus\u2013 it\u2019s tempting to go to the next thing prematurely\u2013 but we need to keep the focus and stay the course on the tasks in the here and now.\\n\\n### JB seems so inclusive and friendly, so I\u2019m wondering: where are all the assholes?\\n\\nI\u2019m kind of a proponent of assholery, if it\u2019s needed. \\n\\n### So wait, JB doesn\u2019t need it now? Did it ever?\\n\\nAt JB, we\u2019re doing a thing and everyone has a mode of operation\u2013 when you talk about inclusivity, it\u2019s not saying that anything goes. After all a lot of people are taking a lot of risk here, and we can\u2019t be inclusive of things like cutting corners or taking simple approaches that don\u2019t match the complexity of a problem. I don\u2019t think being an asshole is good, obviously, but sometimes you do need to focus in the conversation, and there will always be some people who don\u2019t want to do that, but I think that\u2019s where the limit is to the inclusivity. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s assholes around, but if we needed them to keep us honest, or if a situation requires people to act that way to make real progress, then maybe we\u2019d see more of them. Fortunately at JB we\u2019re a good team and we communicate well, the transparency is there, but if that wasn\u2019t the case then I don\u2019t know that assholes would be a bad thing.\\n\\n### Who is your favorite JB contributor, and why is it Zeugh?\\n\\nZeugh is a complex, charming character. I\u2019m a sucker for really complex, charming characters. I don\u2019t care for yea-sayers or nay-sayers, and people like Zeugh are their own person. Love him for it.\\n\\nWithout question peri is my favorite for many reasons, Zeugh for many reasons, Mieos for many reasons. Twodam is a fucking legend, he\u2019s subtle and sometimes goes unnoticed but holy moly, anytime I talk to anyone about some of our contributors twodam comes up and oh my goodness, what an incredible incredible person. \\nNot a fair question.\\n\\nFolks who have a strong belief or mindset or some part about them that isn\u2019t looking to step aside (or who just want to be there by association), but rather people who want to be there because of who they are, that tends to be the ones that stick out to me. People who, given a good enough idea, argument or situation, will 100% get behind something and contribute to its success, even if they at first have a hard time with it, are the kinds of people that stick out to me. It\u2019s not stubbornness per se; it\u2019s productive arguments and debates and vibes and fun.\\n\\nOh man\u2026 It\u2019s impossible to pick a favorite, but that characteristic of people is definitely important to me.\\n\\n### Excellent answer. Okay, final question! What\u2019s something people would be surprised to learn about you?\\n\\nI\u2019m not a very fun or interesting person, really. Nothing to see here, move along."},{"id":"juicebox-in-the-words-of-filipv","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-in-the-words-of-filipv","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2022-04-01-juicebox-in-the-words-of-filipv.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-04-01-juicebox-in-the-words-of-filipv.md","title":"Juicebox in the Words of filipv","description":"\u201cJuicebox in the words of\u201d is a series that highlights JB community members in interview form.

Learn about members\u2019 roles at JB and what makes them tick.*\\n\\n*Today, we\u2019re getting the inside scoop on filipv, a JB workhorse who seems to always be ready to jump in and find a solution. From running blog posts, editing podcasts and writing and editing governance protocols, filipv does it all and then some, and keeps a great positive attitude throughout. Read below to get to know him a bit better!*\\n\\n### How\'d you get started with JB, and how has it changed since you\'ve been here?\\n\\nI got started through a tweet that I saw; I was on twitter, managing another account, and I saw a tweet from Nicholas asking for help with social media.\\n\\nSo I joined the discord server and it was pretty sweet\u2026 people were really nice\u2026 I said in the server that I wanted to do social media, and [9birdy9](https://twitter.com/elliot_paschal) asked me to help with governance issues, and one thing led to another and now I\u2019m doing quite a bit of stuff.\\n\\nSince I got here, back in November 2021, JB has grown a lot. That\u2019s led to a few things\u2013 one is that the culture has evolved, it\u2019s gotten a bit more serious and formal, but we\u2019ve also had a really large demographic shift as the Chinese community has taken greater interest in JB. The team has grown, and I feel like we\u2019ve moved into a higher gear work-wise, and become more efficient as a team.\\n\\n### How would you describe your role at JB?\\n\\nIf I had to put a title, I guess \u201coperations\u201d, or \u201coperations generalist\u201d. I have varying amounts of skill in a number of places, and I try my best to chip in where I can, but that also means I\u2019m pretty diverse in what I do; I tend to be shifting more toward governance stuff/writing proposals, but generally I just look at what JB is doing, and I try to help steer the ship in a direction that is fitting.\\n\\n### In my experience at JB so far, everyone\u2019s been very nice and helpful, so I\u2019m wondering: where are all the assholes?\\n\\nI would say a lot of times people become assholes in a corporate setting due to resentment that stems from a lack of honesty or allowing expression, but JB is quite good at facilitating expression. Also I think JB attracts a different type of person\u2013 there\u2019s no job interview, manager telling you what to do, etc.-- you really have to be a self-starter, and since everything is handled by voting by your peers, there\u2019s real incentives for you to get along; if you\u2019re an asshole, people will vote you out.\\n\\n### What\u2019s something that people would be surprised to find out about you?\\n\\nHmm. I play trumpet, and I worked as a jazz musician in New York. I\u2019m getting to be a bit of a coffee snob as of late. Oh, and at one time I was nationally ranked in yu-gi-oh.\\n\\n### What\u2019s been some of your most exciting experiences at JB so far?\\n\\nAll the events around AssangeDAO, despite the chaos, were really fun to be a part of. That being said, every time I do a new project I get very excited.\\n\\n### And finally: who\u2019s your favorite JB community member, and why is it peri?\\n\\nGotta be the sex appeal."},{"id":"juicebox-in-the-words-of-zom-bae","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-in-the-words-of-zom-bae","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2022-03-30-juicebox-in-the-words-of-zom-bae.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-30-juicebox-in-the-words-of-zom-bae.md","title":"Juicebox in the Words of Zom_Bae","description":"We\u2019re kicking off a new blog series, \u201cJuicebox in the Words of\u201d, where a community member gets interviewed about their experience contributing to JB.

Read on for a glimpse into Zom_Bae\u2019s role at JB and personality as one of our very amazing community members!*\\n\\n### How\'d you get started with JB, and how has it changed since you\'ve been here?\\n\\nOh wow...great question! \\nI initially started quietly lurking in JB honestly because I know and admire the team who created it.  I have zero technical background so as you can probably imagine...I had no clue what any of them were talking about.  I can\'t remember exactly when I joined, but probably around October \'21.  The discord was still pretty small, I think we there were max 5-6 people on town hall calls so it was very close knit but very welcoming to normies like myself (which to be honest, it\'s still a pretty tight group of contributors who are also still very welcoming imo even though the membership has grown quite a lot)!  I started slowly but surely participating, asking questions (even \\"dumb\\" ones),  then ultimately took on a pm role to help keep people moving in a forward direction and tasks from slipping through cracks.  Since I joined, JB has definitely matured.  Processes have been dialed in, incredible work teams have come together, grown and transitioned into their own DOAs  (amazing!), and the synergy in how, so many people, from all over the world is nothing less than awe inspiring! \\n\\n### That is some awesome background, really interesting stuff. It sounds like you have a pretty wide perspective, having been here so long compared to many. So for your role here, how would you call yourself? It sounds like you\'re kind of a fixer, somebody who comes and makes things run smoothly, patches up cracks that arise, etc.\\n\\nSo, I like that observation- but certainly not a fixer technically speaking-I guess more along the lines if something isn\'t getting done, I give soft nudges for reminders.  I also like to think I\'m a connector.  If new folks come in, looking for something in particular, whether an answer to a protocol question or how to get started with picking up tasks, I do a decent job pointing them in the right direction, then following up when necessary.  I\'m like one of those old phone operators...just connecting dots! \\n\\n### Between you and me and the rest of the internet, who is your favorite contributor, and why is it jango?\\n\\nfavorite contributor...hard question. I\'m going with the pc answer here: they\'re all freaking rad humans! There\'s no way I can pick just one. Nice try though (although pay close attention to Dr. Gorilla- he\'s got some jokes)!\\n\\n### That\'s a fair and diplomatic response, I expected nothing less. I\'ll notate that Dr. Gorilla is your favorite.\\n\\nlol he\'s *one of* my favs. \\n\\n### Are there any projects on JB that you\'ve been really stoked about, or what would you say is a moment of great excitement you\'ve experienced at JB?\\n\\nI think Movement Dao is something to keep an eye on. It feels special in a way that none of the other projects to date have.  They\'re really trying to find ways to create \\"movements\\" to make the world a better place without it feeling hokey or like a canned answer in a beauty pageant (are they even called that anymore- don\'t get me cancelled!).  One thing I heard in a recent town hall was \\"community can solve our biggest problems\\" and that stuck with me!  IMO, they\'re doin\' it right! go check \'em out! \\n\\nAs far as a moment of great excitement at JB would have to include when constitution DAO popped off...that. was. wild.   I believe it was around Thanksgiving- I went to bed knowing one, peaceful, calm version up JB and woke up to a whirlwind of new members, wen moon, and tons of questions!  Zeugh and Nicolas took the brunt of that, definitely get their versions-great stories- but man, it was intense!\\n\\n### Sounds intense! I\u2019ve been taken aback at how approachable and nice and inclusive people have been here at JB, so I\u2019m wondering, where are all the assholes?\\n\\nlololol...JB is a \\"No Asshole Zone\\"\\n\\n### Haha, that\u2019s what everyone\u2019s been telling me. What is something about you that would surprise other JB members to learn?\\n\\nhmmm.... I\'m in my college\'s hall of fame for volleyball\\n\\n### That\u2019s awesome! Do you still play at all?\\n\\neh, not really- occasionally if I feel like makin\' bitches cry. \\n\\njk jk jk jk\\n\\n### I almost shed a tear... Nowadays what are your hobbies outside of the cryptosphere?\\n\\nMountain biking, keeping plants alive, and am taking a course to become a certified life & wellness coach\\n\\n### Oh that\u2019s awesome, that sounds like a lot of fun.\\n\\nas long as I\'m not running into trees! or do you mean the coaching...?\\n\\n### Yes to coaching!\u2014 although running into trees could be a problem for both wellness and mountain biking\u2026 and plant care. Last question!\u2014 it\u2019s the future, and you can make your ideal web space, whether that\u2019s a DAO or any online space at all\u2014 what do you think you\u2019ll make?\\n\\noooo, good question.  I\'m actually trying to answer that for myself.  I want to figure out a way to gamify wellness that\'s enjoyable and doesn\'t feel like a task. Wellbeing is so so crucial but is so easily ignored because most people just don\'t know what they don\'t know (ie: don\'t realized they can feel better physically and mentally). What that looks like exactly...stay tuned."},{"id":"unbridled-creativity","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/unbridled-creativity","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2022-03-25-unbridled-creativity/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-25-unbridled-creativity/index.md","title":"Unbridled Creativity: The DAO experience through the lens of Cryptovoxels","description":"The Cryptovoxels environment from above","date":"2022-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"2022\u5e743\u670825\u65e5","tags":[{"label":"dao","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/dao"},{"label":"observations","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/observations"}],"readingTime":2.755,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Felixander","title":"Community Member","url":"https://twitter.com/realfelixander","imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1509677708854239233/Bsru0Xks_400x400.jpg","key":"felixander"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"unbridled-creativity","title":"Unbridled Creativity: The DAO experience through the lens of Cryptovoxels","authors":["felixander"],"tags":["dao","observations"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Juicebox in the Words of Zom_Bae","permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-in-the-words-of-zom-bae"},"nextItem":{"title":"Juicebox Benefits Program Explained","permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-benefits-program-explained"}},"content":"![](image.png)The Cryptovoxels environment from above\\n## A new way to wind down\\n\\nThe DAO space online isn\u2019t like your average experience working at a company or corporation. Unlike the physical environment of offices, cubicles, and maybe the occasional beanbag chair if you happen to work at one of those *fun* places, the online space where DAOs operate is free from constraints and incentives. It\u2019s a space where people create for the sake of it, and pool effort together as a means of expression. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are plenty of endeavors out there that seek to make money, but the crucial difference is about what we call the bottom line, and what it looks like in a DAO space versus traditional settings.\\n\\nEnter Cryptovoxels: an online space where participants can congregate, listen to music together, and even enjoy a \u201clive\u201d show in a virtual environment (pictured above). The Cryptovoxels space isn\u2019t unique for what it is\u2014 plenty of paid spaces exist that try to achieve the same goal. The reason Cryptovoxels is unique is precisely for what it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s not about raising money, or pandering to users for shares and likes and what have you. It\u2019s a space to wind down and enjoy together in a uniquely anti-consumerist experience. A space where creatives, programmers, technical writers, holders and any and all between can congregate for the sake of it.\\n![](image-1.png)A lounge in the Cryptovoxels space\\n## Creating for the sake of it\\n\\nSpaces like Cryptovoxels are unique because of how they come about. In a traditional work environment or major corporation, somebody at the top may have an idea to create a space such as Cryptovoxels. From there, the idea would distill as it trickled down the workforce, ultimately culminating in strict directives and program managers. In other words, the project would itself become work\u2014 anathema to its very purpose!\\n\\nIn the DAOsphere, the whole process is put on its head. Eager community members, excited to contribute to a greater organization, and at times simply wanting to spin their wheels, generate projects such as Cryptovoxels not in order to make money, not in order to boast, not in order to monetize an experience, but, rather, simply to enjoy a moment\u2014 a happening, a vibe\u2014 with one another in a shared space. Where else can we say that this is the case?\\n![](image-2.png)A Cryptovoxel room, replete with revolving door and anonymous puppet avatar)\\n## Web 3.0 is a state of mind\\n\\nThe spaces engendered by an overall feeling toward collaboration, decentralization and egalitarian work-force options are encapsulated by Cryptovoxels. They\u2019re spaces that uniquely represent a way of thinking about the world and its members differently than before. They represent an open view of the world that seeks to collaborate into greater and greater projects without, importantly, treating everything in accordance with it\u2019s bottom-line monetary value.\\n\\nThe era of web 3.0 is ushering in a way of thinking inclusively and openly about collaboration unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before. The irony that the same Web 3.0 that brought us NFTs of just about everything can also bring us closer together in a completely non-exploitative way is rich, to be sure. But seeing this irony as a beauty, rather than a contradiction, is probably a better representation of the spirit of our times."},{"id":"juicebox-benefits-program-explained","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-benefits-program-explained","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2022-03-11-juicebox-benefits-program-explained.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-11-juicebox-benefits-program-explained.md","title":"Juicebox Benefits Program Explained","description":"You can claim your JBX here!

The score rewards active contributors by measuring governance participation, and rewards long-term support by measuring how long a wallet has held JBX.\\n\\n### *Governance Factor (60%)*\\n\\nThe *Governance Factor* measures the number of [Juicebox Snapshot proposals](https://snapshot.org/#/jbdao.eth) that a wallet has voted in. The wallet with the highest Governance score is given 600 points, and the wallet with the lowest score is given zero. All other wallets are linearly scored within those bounds\u2014for example, a wallet that voted in half as many snapshot proposals would be given 300 points.\\n\\n### *HODL Factor (40%)*\\n\\nThe *HODL Factor* measures the number of UTC dates that a wallet has held at least 1 JBX (either claimed or unclaimed). The wallet with the highest HODL score is given 400 points, and the wallet with the lowest score is given zero. All other wallets are linearly scored within those bounds\u2014for example, a wallet that held JBX for half as many dates would be given 200 points.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How to Claim\\n\\nVisit [airdrop.juicebox.money](https://airdrop.juicebox.money/) and connect your wallet to see if you are eligible. You can also claim a free passport to view this score (and other scores) on [arcx.money](https://arcx.money/).\\n\\nOn 2022-06-07 at 22:00 UTC, any unclaimed JBX which remains in the smart contract will be returned to the multisig for future use.\\n\\n*Your score on arcx.money might not be the same as your score on airdrop.juicebox.money. To prevent sybil attacks, the airdrop scores were measured at Ethereum block 14,263,369.*\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What\'s Next?\\n\\nGoing forward, the community could use the Juicebox Benefits score to make new airdrops, to set up a gated [Merch Squad collection](https://juicebox.money/#/p/merchsquad), to make gated Discord roles, or even to create exclusive Juicebox-themed [ARCx passport skins](https://arcx.substack.com/p/introducing-defi-passport-skins?s=r). These scores are verifiable onchain, meaning they can be permissionlessly used in smart contracts or used through an API.\\n\\nSome other examples mentioned by ARCx include:\\n\\n- Distributing airdrops equitably\\n- Boosting smart contract staking yields\\n- Verifying social status via Discord roles\\n- Offering free smart contract insurance to the best users\\n- Fee & product discounts\\n- Many more\\n\\nThis score evolves with your behaviour over time! Although the methodology could evolve, Juicebox Benefits projects aim to reward active contributors which support Juicebox\'s long-term goals.

Juicebox has become a platform to support a thriving ecosystem of DAOs, who are all at different points in their development. It can be tough to stand out through the noise and develop a key marketing strategy for your project or DAO. Starting a successful web3 project is hard work with most projects on JuiceBox failing to attract more than 1 ETH in contributions.\\n\\nHere are 3 tips for giving investors confidence and encouraging ETH contributions for you DAO, that I\u2019ve learned from my time assisting at SharkDao.\\n\\n### Have reputable signers for the multisig and a plan for how those funds are released.\\n\\nOne of the first questions I ask when analyzing DAOs is \u201chow are the funds secured?\u201d If you\u2019ve been paying attention to DeFi news recently you\u2019ll have heard of the Wonderland fiasco, where one member with a shady history was allowed to manage the treasury of the DAO. This has not bode well for $TIME price action and the Wonderland community. Having reputable signers to properly store and distribute finds is crucial to the success of a DAO, no matter how big the treasury is.\\n\\nThe most common way to secure funds is to have multiple signers on Gnosis safe (more info here) to ensure that not any single person can rug the project. Many DAOs I\u2019ve seen get past the first step of having a gnosis safe in the first place instead of just one wallet, but then fail the second part of security which is having reputable signers.\\n\\nHaving singers that check off at least some of these boxes can be a big confidence boost for potential members looking to invest into your project.\\n\\n1. A signer with an established presence on twitter\\n2. A signer involved in multiple projects throughout the crypto space\\n3. A signer who is doxxed and is reputable outside of the metaverse\\n4. A member of the Juicebox team\\n5. A member of a different prominent DAO or multisig signer.\\n6. A paid reputable neutral party to assist with signing (crypto funds, institutions, etc.)\\n\\nAsk around on discord and twitter, and you may be pleasantly surprised by the generosity of the web3 community to assist in your DAO, and maybe even make a friend or two.\\n\\n### Have a tokenomics and governance strategy\\n\\nIf people are going to be contributing to your project, it helps to let potential new members know what exactly they are buying into. Slush funds, for vague and unspecified purposes are a red flag for potential rug pulls or honeypots on Juicebox.\\n\\nBefore starting a project on Juicebox, it\u2019s best to clarify to potential new members: what is the purpose of your projects coin?\\n\\nWhen someone contributes to your project, what does the token they get in return represent? Natively, Juicebox allows projects to enable token holders make a claim on a projects treasury, but beyond that token utility is only bound by social or legal agreements.\\n\\nSome ideas to add utility:\\n\\n1. Governance rights. Each token represents a single vote in off chain voting tools like Snapshot.\\n2. Token gating. Requiring either one or multiple tokens to enter select or all discord sever channels.\\n3. Claim on treasury. Juicebox allows projects to let token holders make a claim on a projects treasury, and burn coins for eth.\\n4. Mint pass. Holding tokens allows you an ability to mint free or paid NFTs.\\n\\nExperiment, stand out, think of new and novel ideas for both your governance and tokenomics, and you\u2019ll be far more likely to and attract attention to your project.\\n\\n### Have a friendly and inviting discord, fun and exciting twitter, and a thorough FAQ that is updated regularly.\\n\\nThe first two touch points people are likely to have with your project are going to be your Twitter and Discord. Twitter and Discord have become the two go-to platforms for web3 communities, and are a tried and true recipe for success. Most web3 projects don\u2019t ever launch to platforms like Instagram and Tiktok and still remain highly competitive. While other social media platforms may be helpful for your project, it\u2019s best to stick to only twitter and discord, especially if you\u2019re stretched for time and talent. If you market your twitter+discord well, it is far more effective than half a dozen social media platforms marketed mediocrely.\\n\\nSuccessful web3 projects are able to leverage their twitter to attract high quality community members, who often become key contributors. Potential members will find your discord and evaluate the strength of your project, often based on aesthetic values at a first glance. Here\u2019s a checklist to help you make sure your socials are well maintained\\n\\nTwitter:\\n\\n1. Push twitter updates regularly. Daily is best, but at a bare minimum twice a week, or your project will start to appear absent and unmanaged.\\n2. Reply and engage with other twitter accounts, don\u2019t only push status updates.\\n3. Have an engaging pinned tweet, and aesthetically pleasing profile picture+banner. First impressions are important.\\n4. Offer giveaways and contests to encourage engagement (don\u2019t overdo it!).\\n\\nWhen starting a discord, it\u2019s important that there\u2019s someone to greet new members, be friendly, and answer questions. This person of contact is often called a community manager (CM). In larger projects, there\u2019s often a dedicated CM to do this job, but in smaller projects this job usually falls to someone on the founding team. Regardless of who is assigned to these tasks, it\u2019s important that there always be someone answering questions and directing people to proper resources in a reasonable amount of time. \xa0Here are some tips to make a community managing less stressful, and more engaging for members.\\n\\nDiscord:\\n\\n1. Keep channels to a minimum when possible.\\n2. Clear and concise channel names and descriptions.\\n3. Create an FAQ + resource guide and update it regularly. If a question is asked twice, it\u2019s a frequently asked question. Chances are it will be asked a third time.\\n4. Offer a fun and engaging role system for your discord. Some ideas: react roles where people can self assign, being helpful gets its own role, donators/investors get their own role.\\n5. Same as twitter, offer giveaways and contests to encourage engagement (again, don\u2019t overdo it!)\\n\\nPut time, love, and energy into your socials and you\u2019ll attract both capital and talent to your project.\\n\\n-Synth"},{"id":"year-of-the-dev","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/year-of-the-dev","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2021-12-30-year-of-the-dev.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-12-30-year-of-the-dev.md","title":"Year of the Dev","description":"- Devs aren\'t just coders.

During a funding cycle where minting new tokens is allowed, the project owner can submit a transaction to increase the token supply and send this new supply to a beneficiary of its choice. \\n\\nCurrently projects can only mint new tokens before receiving a first contribution.\\n- **Burn - **Anyone will be able to burn their tokens by redeeming them, even when there is no overflow. \\n\\nCurrently tokens are only burnable when there is some amount of overflow that is being reclaimed through the redemption.\\n- **Off-protocol redemption value - **Projects will be able to supply a contract to their funding cycles that tell the protocol how much value it is holding off-protocol, like in a multisig wallet or yielding vault. Projects can use oracles in this contract to convert the value of any other asset it owns into ETH for the protocol to use when calculating redemption values.\\n\\nCurrently redemption values are calculated only with the ETH the project has locked in the Juicebox Terminal contract.\\n- **Fee cap -** The protocol fee is capped at 5%. JuiceboxDAO can adjust the JBX fee from 0% - 5%.\\n\\nCurrently there is no fee cap. \\n\\n### Bug fixes\\n\\n- Fixed bug that prevents a project from updating its reserved token tracker when the reserved rate is set to 0%. This bug prevented the project from reconfiguring from a 0% reserved rate to any other value without inadvertently creating an extra reserved token supply inso-doing. See this [postmortem](__GHOST_URL__/juicebox-postmortem-of-low-severity-bug-discovered-8-18-2021/). \\n- Fixed bug that prevented overflow from being viewed correctly when a funding cycle rolls over before it has had its newly available funds distributed.\\n\\n### Other adjustments\\n\\n- The contract is now directly Ownable instead of using an ownable Governance contract proxy.

I then stumbled upon JB after finding out about the NOUNS project and then finding SharkDao which was using Juicebox for its treasury.\\n\\nWhat I talked about with this JB community member was the fact that I didn\'t say a word in Juicebox for 2 - 3 weeks. \xa0I attended a couple of town hall meetings and listened in on some voice chats that were happening, not knowing what the agenda was or what they were going to be talking about. \xa0I remember reading a bunch of \xa0threads in Discord, trying to follow one or two specific issues, to see how the community tried to solve them. \xa0What became clear was that it was important for me to not try to understand what a few people were doing, but to try and understand what the community was doing. \xa0That was an epiphany for me. \xa0It made me ask, \\"where do this community\'s values and my personal beliefs and ethics intersect?\\"\\n\\nThis was the moment I started to look for tasks that helped me align myself with the community philosophy. \xa0I started to shift my mindset from a quiet observer to thinking about how I could provide value that \xa0could help advance the protocol and in turn, the Juicebox Community. \xa0As I was exploring, I realized that I was also learning how to navigate the community. \xa0How to navigate the notion, the web site, the Discord and everything else that might go along with JB.\\n\\nTo those wanting to become Juicebox contributors: follow a couple of tasks or issues and see how those issues are being solved by the community. \xa0Then see if those solutions line up with how you might handle those issues. **That doesn\'t mean you have to agree.** \xa0It just means that how we talk to each other and how we interact with each other lines up with how you want to talk to people and how you want to be talked to.\\n\\nIf you start this way, not only will you find a way to contribute but you will see that the Juicebox community will help you contribute. \xa0You\'ll see that Juicebox will view you not just as someone that has a valuable skill but someone that has a philosophy that aligns with the goals of the Juicebox community."},{"id":"state-of-jbx","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/state-of-jbx","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2021-12-07-state-of-jbx.md","source":"@site/i18n/zh/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2021-12-07-state-of-jbx.md","title":"\u89c2\u5bdf:

inefficiencies","permalink":"/zh/blog/notice-juicebox-fundraise"}},"content":"*In its first funding cycle, each project issues 1,000,000 tokens for each 1 ETH received.*\\n\\n### Level 0\\n\\nIn its simplest form, a Juicebox project can be configured to fundraise and provide refunds. \\n\\nExample: I pay 5 ETH into a treasury and receive 5,000,000 tokens, and you pay 5 ETH and receive 5,000,000 tokens. There are now 10 ETH in the treasury and 10,000,000 tokens total. Since I own half of the tokens, I can redeem them to get half of the treasury\'s total \u2013 in other words I can get a refund. You can do the same.\\n\\n### Level 1\\n\\nA reserved rate can be added which will allocate a percentage of the minted token supply to a preprogrammed list of addresses.\\n\\nExample: The project sets a 10% reserved rate that goes to the DAO\'s multisig address. I pay 5 ETH into a treasury and receive 4,500,000 tokens, and you pay 5 ETH and receive 4,500,000 tokens. The DAO\'s multisig now has access to 1,000,000 tokens. Because of the reserved rate, I can no longer redeem my tokens to get a refund \u2013 I will only get 90% of what I paid. \\n\\nAt a reserved rate of 100%, no tokens go to new contributors.\\n\\n### Level 2\\n\\nA funding cycle target can be set which blocks off some funds from the treasury that can be distributed by anyone to a set of preprogrammed addresses.\\n\\nExample: The project sets a target of 1 ETH. I pay 5 ETH into a treasury and receive 5,000,000 tokens, and you pay 5 ETH and receive 5,000,000 tokens.\\nThe treasury now has 10 ETH \u2013 \xa01 ETH is within the target, and the other 9 are considered overflow. I can redeem/burn by tokens to receive my proportion of the overflow, which is 4.5 ETH. The 1 ETH target is still distributable to the project and not accessible to token holders.\\n\\n### Level 3\\n\\nA redemption bonding curve can be added which reduces the amount of the treasury that can be reclaimed by redeeming tokens. \\n\\nExample: The project sets a 50% bonding curve. I pay 5 ETH to the treasury and receive 5,000,000 tokens, and you pay 5 ETH and receive 5,000,000 tokens. Because of the redemption bonding curve, I will only receive ~2.5 ETH if I redeem my tokens. The rest is left to share by those who are holding, so you could now redeem your tokens and get the remaining ~7.5 ETH.\\n\\n### Level 4\\n\\nA discount rate can be added to decrease the rate of tokens that are minted and distributed when contributions are received over time. \\n\\nExample: The project sets a 10% discount rate and a 14 day funding cycle duration. \xa0I pay 5 ETH to the treasury and receive 5,000,000 tokens on day one during the first funding cycle. Fourteen days later during the second funding cycle, you pay 5 ETH and receive 4,500,000 tokens.\\n\\n### Level 5\\n\\nIt is important to note that a project can change its reserved rate, target, redemption bonding curve, and discount rate on a per-funding cycle basis. Some projects might choose to have no funding cycle duration for the most flexibility, meaning they can reconfigure the project on demand. It is really important to trust the owner of the project because they have a lot of control to shape the tokenomics. \\n\\nA project can also set a ballot contract in its funding cycle to create conditions according to which all proposed reconfigurations must abide.\\n\\nExample: The project sets a 3-day delay ballot contract. If the project owner wants to reconfigure any funding cycle property, the transaction to do so must be sent at least 3 days before the end of the current funding cycle. If the reconfiguration was made within the 3 days, the next funding cycle will instead be a copy of the current one, and the reconfiguration would be eligible to take effect after that one.\\n\\nPeople can build arbitrary ballot contracts as long as it conforms to [IFundingCycleBallot](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v1/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IFundingCycleBallot.sol)."},{"id":"notice-juicebox-fundraise","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/notice-juicebox-fundraise","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2021-11-27-notice-juicebox-fundraise.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-11-27-notice-juicebox-fundraise.md","title":"NOTICE: Juicebox V1 inefficiencies","description":"Before you start a project on Juicebox V1 or contribute funds to one, understand the following inefficiencies.

These are shortcoming of V1 that have imperfect work arounds for now.\\n\\n1. There is no pause button. The best you can do is configure the reserves rate to 100% if you do not want to give new contributors any tokens. You can set an address responsible for burning tokens as the reserved token recipient.\\n2. When a project\'s reserved rate starts at 0% and is then reconfigured to be higher than 0%, a new token supply will become available to distribute to the preconfigured reserved token recipients according to the rate chosen.

JuiceboxDAO creates a project on each one where fees will be collected and contributions accepted.\\n- JuiceboxDAO will have different tokens on each chain. JuiceboxDAO membership is composed of a strategy that take each of these tokens into account. Members are responsible for managing the entirety of the DAO\'s treasury across all chains.\\n- JuiceboxDAO submits treasury reconfigurations to each chain independently. Each chain can have funding cycles that operate on different schedules, have different token issuance rates, and different ETH distributions. This flexibility can be used to orchestrate arbitrary multi-chain treasury designs, although also introducing management overhead. Extend to new environments responsibly.\\n- JuiceboxDAO can move its ETH/tokens between environments adhering to the constraints of each chain, leaning on existing and upcoming generalized bridging infrastructure.\\n- It can deploy converter contracts if it wishes to support conversions between each of its membership tokens.\\n\\nAny other project could choose to operate on one or many environments where the Juicebox protocol has been deployed. If they choose to operate on many, they would have to manage the complexity of doing so. Once projects have begun experimenting and settling on effective patterns, I\'d hope a playbook would emerge as a reference for future projects.\\n\\nLeaving multi-layer coordination for the social layer introduces some operational overhead and risk, but also keeps the protocol layer flexible and simple."},{"id":"multi-layer-juicebox","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/multi-layer-juicebox","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2021-11-22-multi-layer-juicebox.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-11-22-multi-layer-juicebox.md","title":"Cross-layer Juicebox Protocol","description":"Projects building on Juicebox need payment terminals that cost its contributors less gas to pay and redeem.","date":"2021-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"2021\u5e7411\u670822\u65e5","tags":[{"label":"protocol","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/protocol"},{"label":"observations","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/observations"}],"readingTime":1.815,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jango","title":"JuiceboxDAO Contributor","url":"https://twitter.com/me_jango","imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1414958948189413395/l89bNR2m_400x400.jpg","key":"jango"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"multi-layer-juicebox","title":"Cross-layer Juicebox Protocol","authors":["jango"],"tags":["protocol","observations"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Cross-layer Juicebox protocol: follow up #1","permalink":"/zh/blog/cross-layer-juicebox-pt-2"},"nextItem":{"title":"\u5904\u7406 ConstitutionDAO \u9000\u6b3e\u7684\u51e0\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u65b9\u6848","permalink":"/zh/blog/constitutiondao-refund-brainstorm"}},"content":"Projects building on Juicebox need payment terminals that cost its contributors less gas to pay and redeem.\\n\\nTo do so, projects need to be able to accept funds across many different L2s alongside mainnet.\\n\\nThe simplest option would be to just deploy the same Juicebox protocol in each EVM compatible L2 environment. This forces projects to choose which they would like to operate on, or manage their own complexity if they would like to operate across many. I\'m guessing most projects would prefer to operate everywhere, if only it were easy to do so.\\n\\nJuiceboxDAO runs on the juicebox protocol itself, if we do nothing at the protocol layer and go with this simple option we will come across the same dilemma. If instead we preemptively consider how we can adjust the Juicebox V2 protocol to make cross layer operation simple for us, we\'ll likely also be making it simple for all projects who choose to build around juicebox treasuries.\\n\\nAn effective solution will take into consideration that:\\n\\n- **projects do not want to fragment its community and governance across chains.** All members should be cheering for funds to come in from wherever people care to contribute from, and the project\'s distributed tokens in turn should provide the opportunity to govern its cumulative funds regardless of what chain they\'re on. \\n- **the issuance rate of the project\'s tokens should be synchronizable across all available environments over time.** As funding cycles roll over, it\'s often the case that the weight of token distribution changes. Unless it is by design, there shouldn\'t be arbitrage opportunities across chains. \\n- **funding cycle reconfigurations should either be approved or fail across all environments.** If a project proposes to reconfigure its funding parameters in one environment but the ballot to do so ends up failing, the change should also fail to take effect in all other environments. On the flip side, successful funding cycle reconfigurations should be reflected across chains.\\n\\n---\\n\\n*Stay tuned for specific proposals from me of how this might be achieve across rollup L2s, and please contribute to the conversation with your own ideas so we can arrive at the best possible set of solutions together.*"},{"id":"constitutiondao-refund-brainstorm","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/constitutiondao-refund-brainstorm","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2021-11-19-constitutiondao-refund-brainstorm.md","source":"@site/i18n/zh/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2021-11-19-constitutiondao-refund-brainstorm.md","title":"\u5904\u7406 ConstitutionDAO \u9000\u6b3e\u7684\u51e0\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u65b9\u6848","description":"\u6211\u6b63\u5728\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u601d\u8003\uff0c\u6b22\u8fce\u968f\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u3002\u8bf7\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8ba8\u8bba\u7ec4\u5185\u53d1\u8868\u610f\u89c1\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u770b\u6f0f\u4e86\u8bf7\u63d0\u9192\u6211\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u5230\u6240\u6709\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u70b9\u96be\u3002","date":"2021-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"2021\u5e7411\u670819\u65e5","tags":[{"label":"observations","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/observations"},{"label":"ecosystem\uff0cChinese translation","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/ecosystem\uff0c-chinese-translation"}],"readingTime":8.89,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jango","title":"JuiceboxDAO Contributor","url":"https://twitter.com/me_jango","imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1414958948189413395/l89bNR2m_400x400.jpg","key":"jango"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"constitutiondao-refund-brainstorm","title":"\u5904\u7406 ConstitutionDAO \u9000\u6b3e\u7684\u51e0\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u65b9\u6848","authors":["jango"],"tags":["observations","ecosystem\uff0cChinese translation"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Cross-layer Juicebox Protocol","permalink":"/zh/blog/multi-layer-juicebox"},"nextItem":{"title":"\u6ea2\u51fa\uff1a\u7528\u4e8e\u9000\u6b3e\u3001\u6012\u9000\u3001\u8fd4\u73b0\u53ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5229\u6da6\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u673a\u5236\u3002","permalink":"/zh/blog/overflow"}},"content":"*\u6211\u6b63\u5728\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u601d\u8003\uff0c\u6b22\u8fce\u968f\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u3002\u8bf7\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8ba8\u8bba\u7ec4\u5185\u53d1\u8868\u610f\u89c1\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u770b\u6f0f\u4e86\u8bf7\u63d0\u9192\u6211\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u5230\u6240\u6709\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u70b9\u96be\u3002*\\n\\nConstitutionDAO \u5230\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u67d0\u79cd\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u65f6\u523b\u3002\u6280\u672f\u5c42\u9762\u4e0a\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5c42\u9762\u4e0a\u6211\u4eec\u90fd\u5fc5\u987b\u4f5c\u51fa\u4e00\u4e9b\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u5c06\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u771f\u6b63\u6709\u673a\u4f1a\u7528\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684 PEOPLE \u4ee3\u5e01\u6765\u53d1\u58f0\u3002\\n\\n\u4e0e\u6b64\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4eec\u4e5f\u6709\u673a\u4f1a\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6211\u4eec\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4e3a\u5c06\u6765\u4eba\u4eec\u5e94\u5bf9\u7c7b\u4f3c\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u597d\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002\\n\\n\u8003\u8651\u9000\u6b3e\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u6211\u4eec\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u65b9\u9762\u6709\uff1a\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u6210\u672c\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3001\u65b9\u4fbf\u6027\uff0c\uff08...\uff1f\uff09\\n\\n\u5bf9\u4e8e ConstitutionDAO \u8fd9\u4e2a\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u5904\u7406\u9000\u6b3e\u4e8b\u5b9c\uff08\u80af\u5b9a\u8fd8\u5b58\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u6211\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u6216\u4e0d\u591f\u719f\u6089\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\uff1a\\n\\n### \u901a\u8fc7 Juicebox \u8fdb\u884c\u9000\u6b3e\\n\\n\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a\\n\\n1. \u628a\u8fd94\u5343\u591a\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u91cd\u65b0\u8f6c\u5165\u5230 Juicebox \u5408\u7ea6\u3002\\n2. \u591a\u7b7e\u94b1\u5305\u53d1\u8d77\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ea4\u6613\uff0c\u628a ConstitutionDAO \u7684\u7b79\u6b3e\u5468\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u91cd\u65b0\u914d\u7f6e\u4e3a 0\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5141\u8bb8\u6240\u6709\u4ee3\u5e01\u6309\u76f8\u5e94\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8d4e\u56de\u9879\u76ee\u91d1\u5e93\u91cc\u7684\u5168\u90e8\u8d44\u91d1\u3002\\n3. \u4efb\u4f55\u4eba\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u8d4e\u56de\u4ed6\u4eec\u6301\u6709\u7684 PEOPLE \u4ee3\u5e01\u3002\u6240\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7559\u4e0b\u53c2\u4e0e\u5efa\u8bbe ConstitutionDAO \u7684\u4eba\u5219\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684 PEOPLE \u4ee3\u5e01\uff0c\u5e76\u628a\u8d44\u91d1\u4ea4\u7ed9\u793e\u533a\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u3002\\n4.

preference for those who helped in any capacity in earlier funding cycles. Membership has been open to all since the protocol was deployed.\\n\\nCurrently in Funding Cycle #8, each 10 ETH contributed to the treasury by new or existing members mints the following amounts of JBX:\\n\\n**2,579,260** for the contributing member\\n\\n**416,649** for **JuiceboxDAO**\\n**333,319** for **Peri**\\n**333,319** for **Jango**\\n**97,218** for **Nicholas**\\n**97,218** for **Exekias**\\n**55,553** for **WAGMI Studios**\\n**55,553** for **CanuDAO**\\n\\nToday, it would take a contribution of **278** ETH for the contributing member to get 10% of the total membership tokens.\\n\\nTwo months ago in funding cycle #4, each 10 ETH contributed to the treasury minted **3,931,200** JBX for the member.\\n\\nThe total amount of JBX issued to members per ETH accepted is decreasing by 10% every 2 weeks. At this current rate with 2 week funding cycles and 35% reserved, in funding cycle #12 each 10 ETH contributed to the treasury will only mint **1,692,252** JBX for the contributor.\\n\\n### Observations\\n\\n- Builders and contributors don\'t know what they\'re getting when they contribute ETH or are receivers of reserved tokens.\\n- Membership is getting expensive. \\n- JBDAOs strategy thus far has been to focus on building in the open, while making clear upfront the resources it needs to be able to build effectively.\\n- No one in JBDAO has produced much work proposing how we might make membership more accessible to people or distribute it more widely, or why that might be worth prioritizing. Most of what is discussed is about how to solve problems for juicebox projects and for builders who want to come in and improve/grow the ecosystem. \\n- The way JBDAO is using its 35% reserved rate ensures about 25% of any membership expansion the DAO makes goes to builders who are currently stewarding projects. If the DAO isn\'t growing its treasury, committed builders don\'t become substantial members. The remaining 10% go to JBDAO itself, which it hasn\'t done anything with yet.\\n- The DAO\'s casual builders and helpers currently don\'t have a way to become members other than to make a contribution to the DAO of any amount.\\n- It might be interesting for the DAO to tapper off its discount rate so that over time, members who consider joining are represented and feel welcome.\\n- It might be interesting for the DAO to allocate all of a 35% reserved rate to itself so it can hand out some non-insignificant starter membership amounts to more people who are helping out casually, and to people who are currently cranking out tasks and getting to know the system but don\'t yet plan on sticking around for too long. The DAO could also give membership to other builders around web3 who might be creative and thoughtful voices to have in the room when determining how the DAO could allocate its treasury.\\n\\n### Open questions\\n\\n- How might the DAO distribute its allocation of JBX effectively to add more great members now and into the future?"},{"id":"juicebox-observations-9-28-2021","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-observations-9-28-2021","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2021-09-28-juicebox-observations-9-28-2021/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-09-28-juicebox-observations-9-28-2021/index.md","title":"Reserved tokens as a mechanism for effective token distribution","description":"As funds are contributed to the JuiceboxDAO treasury \u2013 either as direct payments or as fees paid \u2013 JBX is minted and distributed.

Currently, 35% of these are reserved and allocated to preprogrammed addresses while the remaining 65% are sent to the contributor of the payment. \\n\\nThe current distribution of reserved tokens for JuiceboxDAO is as follows:\\n![](image-5.png)\\nThere is no cap to how many JBX are minted into existence: as more ETH is contributed, more JBX is created, albeit at a slightly decreasing rate over time due to the discount rate (currently 10% fewer JBX minted per ETH every 2 weeks). With each payment, the pie being shared grows while everyone\'s share of the pie slightly shrinks.\\n\\n... except for those on the reserved tokens list. At any given moment, their overall JBX positions tend towards the percent of reserved tokens they\'re programmed to receive, at the rate of the treasury\'s growth. This also means that currently 35% of the DAO\'s value tends to concentrate between the reserved token holders, with the remaining 65% going to a long-tail distribution between those who chipped in or paid fees to the treasury over time, favoring those who did so soonest. \\n\\nJuiceboxDAO\'s reserved tokens have thus far been mostly allocated to those few contributors shouldering operational responsibilities to the DAO. Recently the DAO also began reserving tokens for the DAO\'s multi-sig in order to redistribute to LP staking rewards and other programs. \\n\\nGoing forward, the DAO\'s greatest opportunity to coordinate incentives among its community will likely come through expanding the reserved pool to include many new members and campaigns with proven commitments to its success, as well as smaller scoped experimental distributions.\\n\\nWith a few basic guardrails and guidances in place such as those outlined in the [DAO\'s governance documents](https://juiceboxdao.notion.site/Governance-f0ff06c503914500acb9bd646cc4ed65), the DAO should be set up to fairly and efficiently welcome in meaningful contributors, while shedding those who are no longer participating or useful. This process should spread the value the DAO creates to the people actively furthering the project\'s mission statement, and to the projects building on the protocol who are paying fees over time.\\n\\nI\'m very eager to see more reserved token allocation [proposals](https://juiceboxdao.notion.site/Governance-f0ff06c503914500acb9bd646cc4ed65) over the next several months, and for the number of reserved token receivers to grow substantially.\\n\\n### Aside\\n\\nThe reserved rate also makes a 51% takeover very expensive. JuiceboxDAO currently has a total supply of 577,516,558 JBX tokens. Each ETH contributed mints another 544,320 JBX (353,808 to the payer, 190,512 to the reserved pool). In order for someone to mint 51% of tokens for themselves today, they would have to dump 3,865 ETH into the treasury. This will just get more expensive as time goes on since the total supply will increase over time as the number of tokens minted per ETH contributed decreases."},{"id":"project-updates-9-21-2021","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/project-updates-9-21-2021","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2021-09-25-project-updates-9-21-2021.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-09-25-project-updates-9-21-2021.md","title":"Project updates 9/21/2021","description":"Last update: 9/07/2021","date":"2021-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"2021\u5e749\u670825\u65e5","tags":[{"label":"dao","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/dao"}],"readingTime":6.565,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jango","title":"JuiceboxDAO Contributor","url":"https://twitter.com/me_jango","imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1414958948189413395/l89bNR2m_400x400.jpg","key":"jango"},{"name":"Peripheralist","title":"Peel Contributor","url":"https://twitter.com/peripheralist","imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1363876191938183170/DixgVLiq_400x400.jpg","key":"peri"},{"name":"exekias","title":"JuiceboxDAO Contributor","url":"https://twitter.com/odd_amphora","imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1456250808396394501/Wmx55_MC_400x400.jpg","key":"exekias"},{"name":"nnnnicholas","title":"JuiceboxDAO Contributor","url":"https://twitter.com/nnnnicholas","imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1480761142880448512/CkG1f6j1_400x400.png","key":"nicholas"},{"name":"9birdy9","title":"JuiceboxDAO Contributor","url":"https://twitter.com/elliot_paschal","imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1502886383177945089/2PaPZi6q_400x400.jpg","key":"9birdy9"},{"name":"Zeugh","title":"JuiceboxDAO Contributor","url":"https://twitter.com/ZeughFromCanu","imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1509253123675668496/Uhl5hsph_400x400.jpg","key":"zeugh"},{"name":"natimuril","title":"JuiceboxDAO Contributor","url":"https://twitter.com/natimuril","imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1470785381629050885/vpN2eXTD_400x400.jpg","key":"nati"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"project-updates-9-21-2021","title":"Project updates 9/21/2021","authors":["jango","peri","exekias","nicholas","9birdy9","zeugh","nati"],"tags":["dao"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Reserved tokens as a mechanism for effective token distribution","permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-observations-9-28-2021"},"nextItem":{"title":"Project updates 9/7/2021","permalink":"/zh/blog/project-update"}},"content":"Last update: [9/07/2021](https://juicebox.ghost.io/ghost/#/editor/post/6137d34c913014003b92220f)\\n\\n**Current focus areas are:**\\n\\n- Risk mitigation\\n- Protocol upgrades\\n- Web experience\\n- Analytics\\n- DAO relations\\n- Liquidity pools\\n- NFT marketplace\\n- Governance\\n- Materials\\n\\n## Focus areas\\n\\n### Risk mitigation\\n\\n*Goal: Make sure things don\'t go to zero.*\\n\\n*Current team: jango (lead), exekias, peri.*\\n\\n**Updates:**\\n\\n- nothing to report.\\n\\n**Help needed:**\\n\\n- Reviewing V2 docs and tests.\\n- Bug bounties now included in the V2 documentation that\'s underway.\\n\\n### Protocol Updates\\n\\n*Goal: Evolve the protocol to be more useful.*\\n\\nC*urrent team: jango (lead), peri, exekias, nicholas*\\n\\n**Updates:**\\n\\n- Progress on documentation.

Updated architecture, replacing `submit` with `list` function, which will save on gas.\\n- Reaffirmed permisionless design of NFTMKT and v2+ roadmap. \\n- We will also stand up a couple 721 Creator contracts so artists collaborating with JB projects (e.g., Numo with Sharkdao) can create superior NFTs than on the OpenSea creator contract, which is closed source, centrally hosted metadata by default, and a shared contract. We anticipate one 721 contract for closed collections (where token supply is known in advance) and one open minting collection (where artist can add over time). Nico already has a closed collection contract that we can refine. Can also build a simple front-end to make this easy for artist collaborators (and the broader NFT ecosystem). \\n- We continue to experiment with ideas about spinning NFTMKT off into its own JB project because the opportunity is large, and we believe that small teams working on focused projects are more effective than one overwhelmingly large vertically integrated JB protocol team. Perhaps initially staffed by same dev team as JB. Can focus on NFTMKT and the creator contracts. Could collect a fee for NFTs sold through the marketplace (2.5% like opensea?) or could be free. If it had revenue it would have more opportunity to expand dev team. Also thinking about token-swaps between NFTMKT and JB \ud83d\udcc8\ud83e\udd1d. \\n- Increasing belief that NFTMKT will solve the DEX vs JB dilemma facing DEX-traded DAO tokens, where the DEX is always a better price than the JB, by game-theoretic definition. This limits DAOs\' ability to fundraise because DEX trades do not affect DAO treasuries. NFTMKT will allow DAOs like Shark to largely replace direct-to-JB appeals. DEX purchases may still offer cheaper DAO tokens than the NFTMKT, but buyers will not get access to limited edition NFTs via the DEXes. NFTMKT will also be more fun and easy to use for NFT acclimated, compared to JB or DEXes which are unfamiliar to many in that space.\\n- The team is *very* excited about the promising design specification and roadmap for the NFTMKT.\\n- Nicholas also discussed with Mieos affordances in the 721 contracts that will enable WAGMI to create NFTs on behalf of client DAOs.

You\'ve taken a leap of faith on a very experimental and untested set of contracts and user experiences with the hopes that it would help you smoothly realize your vision. The protocol has helped a number of projects bootstrap their treasury and community, and these communities have in turn helped Juicebox root into the fertile soil that is the Ethereum social layer.\\n\\nI\'ve been observing how each project has been interacting with the protocol. I\'ve been a part of exciting discussions where JB was a total enabler of ideas and creativity, and also ones where I\'ve unfortunately had to be the bearer of bad news that the protocol doesn\'t support the wild thought being proposed. I\'ve seen people spin up projects and raise hundreds of ETH in hours, and seen people give up on the first screen because the \\"button\\" they were trying to click wasn\'t actually a button. After only a few weeks of action I have a sense of what\'s working, and I\'ve got a laundry list of what could be better.\\n\\nThe goal is to steadily improve things over time. At the base contract layer however, progress must made in big leaps initially with the goal of eventually reaching a steady state as innovation moves to subsequent application layers. JuiceboxV2 is the first big leap. Its goal is simple: to enable more creativity, and remove all points of friction.\\n\\nJuiceboxV1 was designed with the assumption that communities and project owners have adverse incentives. By using Juicebox, a project owner was committing to particular constraints so that their community could confidently embrace the finances of the game being proposed. Project owners could not mint or burn tokens at will, project owners could not dictate how many tokens were minted per ETH contributed, project owners could not limit who participated in a crowdfund, and project owners did not have a pause button.\\n\\nTurns out this was a bad assumption to roll with at the base protocol layer. If a community and its owners are one and the same, flexibility is a requirement for total creative expression. It turns out that communities almost always crave a custom treasury strategy that fits their ethos and proposes a game that differentiates them from others. \\n\\nProjects don\'t usually have the engineering resources to build, test, and verify such solutions though. This has been a core value Juicebox has provided for people, along with a simple and powerful UI for community members to join in through and follow along with. So far, the frictions that Juicebox removes has justified the treasury strategy constraints that it introduces. \\n\\nLet\'s see if we can now do even better.\\n\\n## Proposed changes\\n\\n### Bring your own mint/burn strategy\\n\\nYou\'ll now be able to bring your own contracts that outline the game you want to propose to your community. You\'ll be able to plug and play with already-written strategies, or write your own custom one that fulfills your wildest ideas.\\n\\nWriting a strategy can be simple, or as complex as you want. All that is required is providing a contract that adheres to [the `IFundingCycleDataSource` interface](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-juicehouse/blob/version/2/packages/hardhat/contracts/interfaces/IFundingCycleDataSource.sol). You\'ll be able to provide a strategy that decides what happens when someone makes a payment to your project, as well as one for when someone redeems their treasury tokens. \\n\\nHere\'s how writing a strategy around a payment works:\\n\\nYou can add a data source contract as a parameter to a funding cycle. Your data source must provide a function that implements the following function specification.\\n\\n    function payData(\\n        address _payer,\\n        uint256 _amount,\\n        uint256 _baseWeight,\\n        uint256 _reservedRate,\\n        address _beneficiary,\\n        string calldata _memo\\n    )\\n        external\\n        returns (\\n            uint256 weight,\\n            string calldata memo,\\n            IPayDelegate delegate\\n        );\\n\\nThe function receives a handful of parameters from the Juicebox protocol, and is expected to return a handful of parameters back. \\n\\n**Inputs:**\\n\\n- `_payer` is the address that issued the ETH payment.\\n- `_amount` is the amount of the ETH payment received.\\n- `_baseWeight` is the weight of the funding cycle during which the payment is being made. This weight is determined by multiplying the previous cycle\'s weight by the previous cycle\'s discount rate. Each project\'s first funding cycle\'s weight is 10^24. \\n- `_reservedRate` is the reserved rate of the funding cycle during which the payment is being made. This percent is out of 200. \\n- `_beneficiary` is the address that the payer has specified to receive the resulting treasury tokens. \\n- `_memo` is the note that the payer has included in the payment.\\n\\n**Outputs:**\\n\\n- `weight` is the weight that the Juicebox protocol should use when minting treasury tokens. The total tokens minted will be `amount` * `weight`, where both variables are assumed to have 18 decimal places. Out of these minted tokens, some will be allocated to the `_beneficiary`, and the rest will be reserved to be distributed to the reserved token recipients according to the `_reservedRate`.\\n- `memo` is the memo to include with the protocol event that will be emitted as a result of the payment. \\n- `delegate` is the address of a contract that adheres to the [`IPaymentDelegate` interface](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-juicehouse/blob/version/2/packages/hardhat/contracts/interfaces/IPayDelegate.sol). If a `delegate` is provided, it will receive a callback from the Juicebox protocol once it has fully processed the payment. You can return the zero address if you don\'t need this functionality. The callback your delegate contract should implement is as follows:\\n\\n    function didPay(\\n        address _payer,\\n        uint256 _amount,\\n        uint256 _weight,\\n        uint256 _count,\\n        address _beneficiary,\\n        string calldata memo\\n    ) external;\\n\\n- `_payer` is the same as the one *passed in* to your data source.\\n- `_amount` is the same as the one *passed in* to your data source.\\n- `_weight` is the same as the one *returned from* your data source.\\n- `_count` is the number of tokens that were minted for the `_beneficiary`.\\n- `_beneficiary` is the same as the one *passed in* to your data source.\\n- `_memo` is the same as the one *returned from* your data source.\\n\\nThe `recordPayment` function where all of these pieces come together can be found [here](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-juicehouse/blob/a668f03cd926bc4b0afdf35aa2d6e73a566b5d48/packages/hardhat/contracts/TerminalV2DataLayer.sol#L582).\\n\\nA data source and delegate can similarly be provided to your funding cycle that\'ll shape the `recordRedemption` function:\\n\\n    function redeemData(\\n        address _holder,\\n        uint256 _count,\\n        uint256 _redemptionRate,\\n        uint256 _ballotRedemptionRate,\\n        address _beneficiary,\\n        string calldata _memo\\n    )\\n        external\\n        returns (\\n            uint256 amount,\\n            string calldata memo,\\n            IRedeemDelegate delegate\\n        );\\n\\n**Inputs:**\\n\\n- `_holder` is the token holder that is redeeming.\\n- `_count` is the number of tokens being redeemed.\\n- `_redemptionRate` is the redemption rate of the funding cycle during which the redemption is being made.\\n- `_ballotRedemptionRate` is the redemption rate that should be used if the project currently has an active funding cycle reconfiguration ballot.\\n- `_beneficiary` is the address that the redeemer has specified to claim the treasury ETH as a result of redeeming tokens.\\n- `_memo` is the note that the redeemer has included in the redemption.\\n\\n**Outputs:**\\n\\n- `amount` is the amount of ETH that should be sent from your treasury to the `_beneficiary` as a result of redeeming/burning `_count` tokens.\\n- `memo` is the memo to include with the protocol event that will be emitted as a result of the redemption. \\n- `delegate` is the address of a contract that adheres to the [`IRedemptionDelegate` interface](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-juicehouse/blob/version/2/packages/hardhat/contracts/interfaces/IRedemptionDelegate.sol). If a `delegate` is provided, it will receive a callback from the Juicebox protocol once it has fully processed the redemption, but before the `amount` is dispersed to the `_beneficiary`. You can return the zero address if you don\'t want this functionality. \xa0The callback your delegate contract should implement is as follows:\\n\\n    function didRedeem(\\n        address _holder,\\n        uint256 _count,\\n        uint256 _amount,\\n        address _beneficiary,\\n        string calldata memo\\n    ) external\\n\\n- `_holder` is the same as the one *passed in* to your data source.\\n- `_count` is the same as the one *passed in* to your data source.\\n- `_amount` is the same as the one *returned from* your data source.\\n- `_beneficiary` is the same as the one *passed in* to your data source.\\n- `_memo` is the same as the one *returned from* your data source.\\n\\nThe `recordRedemption` function where all of these pieces come together can be found [here](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-juicehouse/blob/2c4a549d22dbcbce393672157636a75fe0e29b45/packages/hardhat/contracts/TerminalV2DataLayer.sol#L821).\\n\\nWith these new tools projects can roll out all kinds of treasury strategies, such as:\\n\\n- restricting payments to only certain addresses.\\n- restricting payments to only addresses that hold certain other assets.\\n- offering different levels of \xa0community membership depending on the state of the blockchain.\\n- restricting payments to be within min/max payment amounts.\\n- creating time weighted rewards.\\n- restricting the max supply of community tokens.\\n- customizing the amount of treasury tokens distributed per ETH received.\\n- minting NFTs for new members.\\n\\n...or any combination of any of these, alongside any other rule you can express contractually.\\n\\n### Overflow allowance\\n\\nPreviously, a project could only access funds within its specified funding cycle target. All overflowed treasury funds over this target was only accessibly by treasury token holders.\\n\\nNow, alongside specifying your funding cycle\'s target, you can specify an amount that you can use from your project\'s overflow on demand. \\n\\nThis is useful for allocating treasury funds for on-off use cases like bug-bounties, one-time contributions, audits, NFT bids, etc.\\n\\n### Open mint/burn\\n\\nPreviously, you could only mint tokens before receiving your first payment, and burning was only done through the redemption mechanism. All other tickets were distributed purely through the payment process according to funding cycle weights that decreased according to your configured discount rates over time.\\n\\nYou can now mint and allocate new treasury tokens at will. All token holders also now have the option to burn their tokens, for whatever reason.\\n\\nThis gives projects more flexibility to design their tokenomics the way they want, while also having an auto-distribution mechanism through Juicebox\'s flexible built-in payment mechanism alongside.\\n\\n### Reserved token distribution endpoints\\n\\nPreviously, payout splits could be directed at Ethereum addresses, other Juicebox projects, and arbitrary contracts that inherit from a common interface. Reserved tokens could only go to Ethereum addresses.\\n\\nNow, reserved token distributions can also be pointed at Ethereum addresses, the owner of other Juicebox projects, and arbitrary contracts that inherit from [this common interface](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-juicehouse/blob/version/2/packages/hardhat/contracts/interfaces/ISplitAllocator.sol).\\n\\nThis is useful to allow for more composable token distributions. \\n\\n### Pay, withdraw, and redeem can all be paused.\\n\\nPreviously, projects had not quick way to pause community interactions with its treasury.\\n\\nNow, projects are able to individually pause function calls to pay, withdraw funds, and redeem tokens. These controls are configured into each funding cycle.\\n\\nThis gives projects quick levers to use to achieve certain treasury effects. \\n\\n### Adjustable fee\\n\\nPreviously, all projects paid a 5% fee from payouts. \\n\\nNow, projects will pay at maximum a 5% fee that is adjustable by the JuiceboxDAO. There is also a ceiling fee price that is adjustable by the JuiceboxDAO.\\n\\nThis helps the JuiceboxDAO accommodate more projects and experiments into its ecosystem.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nJuiceboxV2 introduces a suite of tools that allow for wild new treasury strategies. What remains constant from V1 is the fact that configurations are locked into funding cycles \u2013 if a project runs on 30 day funding cycles, they can specify creative dynamics into the funding cycle, but once the cycle begins changes can\'t be made until the following one. Also like V1, projects that opt for no duration are choosing the flexibility to make any change on demand. \\n\\nThe [implementation of the new contracts](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-juicehouse/tree/version/2/packages/hardhat/contracts) is done, we\'ve just now got to document, test, and audit everything. All code is public, as will be all documentation and conversation around this upgrade. \\n\\nWe need eyes and scrutiny. Please don\'t hesitate to take a look and help pick things apart. If you plan on spending time on this, please reach out to the DAO in [our discord](https://discord.gg/vwdZrUZb8r) and introduce yourself so we can make sure you\'re rightly compensated for your work.\\n\\nAll projects currently running on Juicebox will be able to seamlessly migrate their treasury to V2. \\n\\nLFG."},{"id":"juicebox-funding-cycle-4-proposal","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-funding-cycle-4-proposal","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2021-08-29-juicebox-funding-cycle-4-proposal.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-29-juicebox-funding-cycle-4-proposal.md","title":"Juicebox: Project update and FC4 proposal","description":"Only a few minor changes are needed for Funding Cycle #4.

Most Juicebox projects who reach scale will likely also come across this need.\\n\\nThe value of SHARK is derived not only from its ETH stored in the Juicebox contracts, but also from the NFTs the DAO has deployed treasury funds to acquire, from the JBX that the DAO has begun accumulating by paying platform fees, and perhaps most importantly from the productive community forming within the project that gives it boundless potential moving forward. The prospective value of each of these assets is dynamic and subject to each individuals\' confidence and risk appetite. This calls for a more fluid market making and order filling strategy than what the Juicebox protocol has provided until now.\\n\\nJuicebox provides SHARK holders an effective way to fundraise and expand, but it doesn\'t yet provide a way for holders to coordinate a value for what they already own \u2013 this is the strength of AMMs. SharkDAO needs both of these features well into the future. If Juicebox wishes to be the go-to treasury protocol for startup projects who scale, it needs to understand how the current mechanic behaves alongside a treasury token liquidity pool, and which protocol adjustments are needed to smooth out any identified market inefficiencies over time.\\n\\n### Current limitations\\n\\nCurrently, Juicebox treasuries have no configurable max-supply of tokens. The protocol always offers people an opportunity to pitch in ETH and receive treasury tokens in return according to the current funding cycle\'s weight, which is determined by the compounding effects of discount rates alongside the currently configured reserve rate.\\n\\nAs a reminder, the discount rate decreases the amount of tokens minted per ETH contributed as funding cycle\'s roll over \u2013 a discount rate of 10% to the current funding cycle means that a contribution of X ETH to the next funding cycle will only yield 90% of the tokens that the same contribution of X ETH made during the current funding cycle would yield. The reserve rate determines how many of these tokens will be reserved to be distributed to preprogrammed addresses instead of to the payer.\\n\\nThe protocol is thus always quoting a value for a project\'s treasury tokens, and inso doing always offering to inflate the supply of tokens to meet this demand in exchange for crowdfunding more ETH. It is thus unrealistic to expect the market price of treasury tokens on an AMM to ever exceed the price quoted by the protocol \u2013 the protocol will always provide a price ceiling. If the secondary market is over, there is an obvious arbitrage opportunity to pull the price back down.\\n\\nThere may, however, be people who received treasury tokens at a discount in the past who are now willing to sell them for profit at a better price than what the protocol is offering. This supply-side pressure happens organically as funding cycles unfold and discount rates compound. On the buy-side, it\'s logical for someone to seek a better deal for treasury tokens from this secondary market than get them from the protocol. If the majority of activity is happening on secondaries beneath the protocol price, the token supply and fundraising efforts will tapper off at this equilibrium.\\n\\nThe big question thus becomes how a project chooses to pursue this equilibrium. Does it tune its discount rate and reserve rate over time with its own fairness principles in mind, using secondary markets as a convenience for buyers and sellers but limiting the market\'s potential to naturally discover its price\'s upper bound? Or does it use the secondary market as a primary indicator of fairness, using the discount rate and reserved rate only to conveniently satisfy its fundraising needs over time? The answer depends on a community\u2019s values. Does it wish to be liberally open, inclusive, and predictable while prioritizing cashflow? Or instead more-strictly protective of the value current members have accrued and took risks for, with strategic fundraising/expansion campaigns down the road that are scoped for value-adding initiatives? Maybe a balance between the two, with principles in place to guide decisions?\\n\\nThe Juicebox toolset has proven to work well for projects who are willing to expand supply to accommodate new funds and new community members. For projects that want to protect the value they have built and conduct more strategic and scoped fundraising campaigns over time, the compounding discount rate and reserved rate mechanisms might not work well within the current protocol\'s constraints.\\n\\n### Solutions\\n\\nThe solution might be simple.\\n\\nFor the Juicebox protocol to be able to accommodate market driven projects, it must allow them to:\\n\\n- specify a supply cap for their treasury token, and \\n- allow them to customize the quantity of treasury tokens that are distributed per ETH received. \\n\\nUnder these conditions, if payments are received into the treasury after the token supply cap is exceeded, no tokens will be minted in return. Otherwise, if the project has set a customized treasury token price point, tokens will be minted according to this rate overriding the current funding cycle\'s weight derived by the compounding discount rates of previous cycles.\\n\\nThese tools allow a project to essentially \\"pause\\" new treasury tokens from being issued, and at any point open up a fixed supply of new tokens to distribute at a specified price point. The reserved rate as it currently exists can work within this pattern to route newly issued tokens to time-bounded distribution mechanisms, incentivized staking pools, the project\'s own multi-sig wallet, etc.\\n\\nAdding these parameters does put more power into the hands of the project owner, which is a tradeoff worth noting. People who contributed funds earlier in a project\'s lifetime will no longer have guarantees that their tokens were issued at a discount compared to the future cycles, and protocol rates are subject to change as dramatically as the project owner desires. Communities must make extra sure that the ownership of their project (represented by an ERC-721 contract) is in the hands of a trustworthy wallet willing to execute decisions collectively agreed upon. I\'m not too worried about this tradeoff because it is already true to large extent in the current implementation.\\n\\nAnother tradeoff of a token supply cap is that it risks the consistency of DAO-to-DAO and Anon-to-DAO collaboration. For example, imagine someone stands up an NFT marketplace that automatically routes percentages of artwork sales to preconfigured destinations, like to SharkDAO\'s treasury. If SharkDAO has a token supply cap in place and has reached this limit, the sale of the artwork would still send the ETH to the treasury, but the artist would not receive any SHARK in return. I\'m also not too worried about this tradeoff because the same effect is possible with the current mechanism if a project tunes its reserved rate to 100%. Each project/artist composing with Juicebox treasuries should always understand the variability of doing so \u2013 rates are subject to change, and so its important to prioritize building relationships with trustworthy projects who make decisions in the open with proper planning and community engagement. \\n\\nAnother detail to note: the configuration of both new parameters will be scoped to funding cycle configurations \u2013 a project running on timed cycles must await a new cycle for changes to the max-supply and weight override parameters to take effect. Projects with longer funding cycle durations and more rigid reconfiguration ballots will thus continue to operate with more predictability, checks, and balances. Another effect of this is that the actual token supply might be greater than the configured max supply if the project ends up minting more tokens during a current, boundless cycle before a queued one with a max-supply becomes active.\\n\\nA proposal is taking shape to implement these two new properties into a TerminalV2 contract within the Juicebox ecosystem. Projects currently running on TerminalV1 will have the option to migrate over once the contract has been deployed and approved.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[Join the JuiceboxDAO Discord]( https://discord.gg/qckstafRcs  ) to add to this discussion and provide alternate ideas and points of view before we move forward with rolling out these additions to the protocol."},{"id":"juicebox-postmortem-of-low-severity-bug-discovered-8-18-2021","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-postmortem-of-low-severity-bug-discovered-8-18-2021","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2021-08-19-juicebox-postmortem-of-low-severity-bug-discovered-8-18-2021/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-19-juicebox-postmortem-of-low-severity-bug-discovered-8-18-2021/index.md","title":"Juicebox postmortem: Low severity bug discovered 8/18/2021","description":"I discovered a low severity bug in the Juicebox protocol last night that affects projects that have received payments while configured with a reserved rate of 0% who later reconfigure the reserved rate to anything greater than 0%.","date":"2021-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"2021\u5e748\u670819\u65e5","tags":[{"label":"protocol","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/protocol"}],"readingTime":6.52,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jango","title":"JuiceboxDAO Contributor","url":"https://twitter.com/me_jango","imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1414958948189413395/l89bNR2m_400x400.jpg","key":"jango"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"juicebox-postmortem-of-low-severity-bug-discovered-8-18-2021","title":"Juicebox postmortem: Low severity bug discovered 8/18/2021","authors":["jango"],"tags":["protocol"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Juicebox V2: Protocol adjustments useful for adding treasury tokens to AMMs","permalink":"/zh/blog/adding-juicebox-treasury-tokens-to-amms"},"nextItem":{"title":"Juicebox: Funding Cycle #3 proposal","permalink":"/zh/blog/funding-cycle-3-proposal"}},"content":"I discovered a low severity bug in the Juicebox protocol last night that affects projects that have received payments while configured with a reserved rate of 0% who later reconfigure the reserved rate to anything greater than 0%.\\n\\nA temporary work around has been identified, and a game plan for removing the bug from the system is in the works.\\n\\nTo mitigate potential exploits before a patch is issued, an exploit breakout team decided to mint 0.5% of total SHARK supply (1,889,066.675747 SHARK) into the multi-sig wallet. This course of action was chosen to prevent further issues. These tokens can be burned if desired.\\n\\nWhat follows is how I discovered the bug, the technical details about it, and what our next steps will be.\\n\\n**TLDR:****Until further notice, projects are not advised to set their reserved rate to 0% if they intend to raise their reserved rate in the near future.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Context\\n\\nTo give them time to plan for for what\'s next, SharkDAO needed a way to pause payments and new members coming in through Juicebox. Juicebox doesn\'t support a `pause` function in its [TerminalV1](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd569D3CCE55b71a8a3f3C418c329A66e5f714431) contract, so Peripheralist and I had to improvise alongside the SharkDAO community.\\n![](image.png)\\nFirst step was to remove the payment form from the UI. This keeps most people from sending in contributions, but someone dedicated to sending a payment would eventually find that the Juicebox contract could still be interacted with directly through other interfaces like Etherscan.\\n\\nTo even the playing field, I had the idea to raise SharkDAO\'s reserved rate to 100%, meaning all payments coming in through the contract would allocate 100% of minted SHARK tokens to preprogrammed addresses instead of to the paying address. With no SHARK incentive for contributing payments, the community would be disincentivized to pay through back-door means, effectively creating the desired `pause` functionality. If anyone did send payments, we could easily refund them the money.\\n\\nAfter running this plan by SharkDAO at a Sharktank town hall meeting, we decided to move forward with it. We would allocate any SHARK minted during this paused period to the multi-sig, which could later be burned if needed.\\n\\nA few details to note: \\n\\n- SharkDAO\'s reserved rate has been set to 0% since its start. \\n- SharkDAO does not use funding cycles with preset durations, meaning changes can be executed on-demand. \\n- SharkDAO\'s Juicebox project is owned by a Gnosis multi-sig requiring 3/5 signatures. I\'m one of the signatories.\\n\\nRight after the call, I got together with multi-sig holders to execute the plan. After one transaction to TerminalV1\'s `configure` function, the reserved rate was successfully updated. I immediately checked the UI to see if things were in order \u2013 thats when I noticed that after having set the reserved rate to 100%, it was now possible to mint and distribute 100% of the current token supply to the preconfigured destination (the multi-sig). Since this distribute transaction is public, anyone who triggered this would effectively double the SHARK supply, and would leave us with unnecessary work after the fact to burn this unintended supply from the multi-sig and communicate the issue to the community.\\n\\nI immediately instructed the multi-sig panel to send another `configure` transaction to TerminalV1 to change the reserved rate back to 0%, and explained that I had to double check something before we could move forward with the plan. This reverted us to the previous state, where payments made to the contract directly would bypass the intended `pause` that was being communicated in the UI.\\n\\n## Technical details\\n\\nThe root of the problem was fairly obvious to me once I noticed the distributable supply in the UI. Once we were back at a safer state, I began work to confirm my assumptions and test a workaround.\\n\\nMany parts of the Juicebox mechanism\'s design are gas optimized, meaning the transactions that are most frequently called are responsible for fewer state changes than those that are infrequently called. The `pay` transaction is by far the most frequently called, so very few state changes take place within this function: the payment is received, and the resulting amount of treasury tokens are minted to the payer in a staked format.\\n\\nImportantly, the reserved token amount is *not* minted during a payment. Instead, this amount is calculated later when the `printReservedTickets` transaction is called. It does so by taking the current token total supply and minting an appropriate amount of new tokens to the preconfigured reserved addresses such that the reserved rate is respected. Most importantly, the mechanism then keeps track of the fact that it has minted reserved tokens for the current token supply so that it doesn\'t create extra reserved tokens later. Given perfect information, it is in the economic best interest of the project to wait to call `printReservedTickets` if the reserved rate is going to increase, and in the community\'s interest to call it before an increase. The opposite is also true. This dynamic allows the protocol to offload a high-gas storage operation from a frequently called `pay` function onto less frequently called operations.\\n\\nUnfortunately, when the reserved rate is 0%, the `printReservedTickets` call assumes there\'s no work to do, and returns before it has had a chance to update the tracker. This prevents anyone from locking in the rate before it is increased. In the [TerminalV1 file](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juicehouse/blob/3555d7baf7fa8ba4bc350140201805c740e3df4e/packages/hardhat/contracts/TerminalV1.sol#L968), the solution is literally just putting line 968 below line 977:\\n\\n![](image-1.png)Current TerminalV1 implementation of `printReservedTickets`\\n## Execution\\n\\nI immediately proposed two workarounds to the SharkDAO admins:\\n\\n- Keep the contract open.\\n- Set the reserved rate to the minimum possible value (0.5%), distribute the allocated reserved tokens to the multi-sig, then move the reserved rate to 100% as intended.\\n\\nWe decided to go with the second option since we needed to set a fair playing field to community members looking to pay, and we could later burn the relatively small amount of SHARK minted to the multi-sig.\\n\\nI then spent a few hours recreating the the original bug in our integration test suite, and wrote an integration test for the proposed solution to confirm it would work as expected (I was making extra sure of everything at this point in the evening.) Once everything was confirmed on my end, I got together with the multi-sig holders to execute the three transactions:\\n\\n1. Change the reserved rate to 0.5%.\\n2. Distribute reserved treasury tokens to the multi-sig. (Anyone can trigger this, so Xaix did it from his personal wallet.)\\n3. Change the reserved rate to 100%.\\n\\nThe side effect is that 1,889,066.675747 SHARK were minted to the multi-sig. Here\'s a screenshot of what the UI looked like after step 1:\\n\\n![](Screen-Shot-2021-08-19-at-12.43.52-AM-1.png)![](Screen-Shot-2021-08-19-at-12.41.21-AM.png)\\nAnd here\'s what it looks like now:\\n![](image-2.png)\\nWe got all of this done in about 2.5 hours.\\n\\n## Takeaway\\n\\nDespite having written extensive unit, integration, and load tests, this condition fell through the cracks. I will keep stressing to the community that Juicebox is still experimental software with high risks. I\'m confident in the way it\'s built and am committed to its improvement, but I\'m not going to pretend that it is perfect.\\n\\nThe good news is that TerminalV1 has a built in mechanism to allow projects to choose to migrate to new terminal contracts that have been approved by JuiceboxDAO\'s governance, so bugs like this can be fixed. \\n\\nWe are now working around the clock to get a TerminalV1_1 safely set up for migration, and extensively tested.\\n\\n**In the meantime, projects are not advised to set their reserved rate to 0% if they intend to raise their reserved rate in the near future.**\\n\\nNext steps:\\n\\n- Deploy TerminalV1_1 that patches this bug.\\n- Consider building a version of the Juicebox Terminal contract that supports pausing payments.\\n- Seek more code reviews and audits, while offering bug bounties to hackers who want to help."},{"id":"funding-cycle-3-proposal","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/funding-cycle-3-proposal","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2021-08-13-funding-cycle-3-proposal.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-13-funding-cycle-3-proposal.md","title":"Juicebox: Funding Cycle #3 proposal","description":"Three trends have characterized these past 30 days:","date":"2021-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"2021\u5e748\u670813\u65e5","tags":[{"label":"governance","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/governance"},{"label":"dao","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/dao"}],"readingTime":6.51,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jango","title":"JuiceboxDAO Contributor","url":"https://twitter.com/me_jango","imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1414958948189413395/l89bNR2m_400x400.jpg","key":"jango"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"funding-cycle-3-proposal","title":"Juicebox: Funding Cycle #3 proposal","authors":["jango"],"tags":["governance","dao"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Juicebox postmortem: Low severity bug discovered 8/18/2021","permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-postmortem-of-low-severity-bug-discovered-8-18-2021"},"nextItem":{"title":"Juicebox: Funding Cycle #2 proposal","permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-funding-cycle-2-proposal"}},"content":"Three trends have characterized these past 30 days:\\n\\n- Several projects were spun up on Juicebox, entrusting the protocol to manage their money, and the JuiceboxDAO staff to help execute their treasury decisions.

They all took on the laid-out risks and lent us their trust.\\n- Some very talented, caring, insightful, passionate people showed the fuck up and want to build.\\n\\nIt may ultimately be too early to tell, but it seems we might have not only found product market fit, we\'ve found it across several different treasury use cases: DAOs that ship products (JuiceboxDAO, TileDAO), DAOs that collect NFTs (SharkDAO), boutique service shops (WAGMI Studios, CanuDAO), NFT galleries, and group bidding. There are still several improvements to make for each of these treasury use cases while maintaining a cohesive experience, and I see clear potential for even more diversity of ideas.\\n\\nWe are a little over 30 days in, this is just the beginning.

I think we can get the hang of having the opportunity to vote on proposals every other week, with decisions made one week prior to them taking effect. \xa0This time frame is only possible thanks to CanuDAO, who\'s staff is managing our communications and operations. They\'ve done a marvelous job getting things organized and keeping everyone on the same page. \\n\\n**Discount rate:** 10% (-6%)\\nThe discount rate should be further reduced by 6%. This is arbitrary, but it continues to give those who commit funds during FC#3 a good discounted rate to adjust for the risk of being early while continuing the process of tapering the rate off.\\n\\nThe goal is to reduce the rate over time as risk subsides (code risk, infrastructure risk, usability risk, organization risk, governance risk).\\n\\nIt pays to be early and to take the risk sooner rather than later.\\n\\n**Bonding curve:** 60% (+-0%)\\nNo need to change this.

We want him on our team.\\n- **nicholas** | *dev: $1.5k*\\nWe need someone who can help us create a generalized NFT marketplace template that pipes a project\'s sales into Juicebox treasuries. This has emerged as a need for several projects in the ecosystem. Nicholas has been working on a product called NFTstory for the past several months and is intimately familiar with the ERC-721 standard and how it can be improved and extended. He\'s expressed interest in working with me to take this project on, he just might be the perfect dev for it. Let\'s see how things go.\\n- **natimuril **| *project support*: $500\\nProjects that are building on Juicebox tend to need someone to be available for questions, ideation, and support.

This is great, but can also be overwhelming to project owners exploring their options. It\'s very helpful for founders and communities to have a Juicebox \\"expert\\" that can help them translate their needs into a Juicebox config, along with a catalogue showcasing several examples of how their project might behave given certain choices.\\n- **Juicebox projects can be very much \\"alive\\".**\\nInstead of baking in a token distribution schedule ahead of time, communities using Juicebox are given the freedom to experiment and refine their strategy together over time (they could also lock it in forever from the start if they want). With this power comes great responsibility, however. Communities need great data and community analytics to make decisions with confidence.\\n- **A funding cycle\'s duration matters. **\\nQuicker cycles give a community more opportunities to make experimental decisions together, more frequent group calls-to-action, and more chances to debate and reassess their commitments. This creates a greater sense of communal experience over the same amount of time \u2013 a project matures more in a month using 7 day funding cycles than 30 day cycles. \\n\\nThe tradeoff is the more immediate need for structure, organization, and formalities. There is hardly time to observe and think on a thesis before taking it to a vote. The constant attention on governance and decision making can also get exhausting and distract from medium/longer term initiatives.\\n\\nA project might want to tune its pacing over time to play with these dynamics.\\n- **Discount rate is the most consequential configurable parameter. **\\nOnce a discount rate is set and tokens begin being distributed, its effects, however subtle, are felt long into the future. This is by design, but it can be easy for a project to let several funding cycles pass forgetting that they had previously set a discount rate. \\n- **Tuning the reserved rate comes with a time-dependent tradeoff.**\\nA community is composed of core contributors, users, and casual contributors \u2013 all play an important role in a community\'s growth. \\n\\nCore contributors are paying the most attention, doing the most work, and contributing the most upfront money. They tend to know of the tokens issued by the Juicebox protocol and their value before contributing, and thus have a conscious incentive to grow the network *now *according to the reserved rate.\\n\\nUsers tend to get involved mostly for the product or ideas being advertised. They only realize *later* that inso doing they\'ve been given tokens by the Juicebox protocol that allow them to benefit from their community\'s growth over time.\\n\\nCasual contributors of a community emerge from users who realize they can participate in giving the tokens they\'ve been receiving more value by paying incrementally more attention and doing incrementally more work. \\n\\nThe reserved rate can thus be tuned to either boost the incentives of core contributors now at the expense of the incentives of emerging contributors later on, or vice versa. \\n\\nThis dynamic can of course be tuned over time.\\n- **Juicebox works really well for communities who build products.** There is no better way to fund a treasury than by piping in revenue from direct sales made off-site. Tiles are a great example: sales made on [tiles.art](https://tiles.art) go directly to TileDAO\'s treasury without the purchaser concerning themselves with the money pool ahead of time. Sure, the value of owning a Tile may in large part come from the community aspect of the DAO and the shared governance of its money, but having a brilliant, intriguing product that people want to buy is what makes the treasury worth governing in the first place."},{"id":"juicebox-roadmap-8-3-2021","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-roadmap-8-3-2021","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2021-08-03-juicebox-roadmap-8-3-2021.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-03-juicebox-roadmap-8-3-2021.md","title":"JuiceboxDAO Roadmap 8/3/2021","description":"From my point of view, JuiceboxDAO has only a handful of big-picture initiatives to focus our efforts on over the next while:","date":"2021-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"2021\u5e748\u67083\u65e5","tags":[{"label":"observations","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/observations"},{"label":"dao","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/dao"}],"readingTime":1.5,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jango","title":"JuiceboxDAO Contributor","url":"https://twitter.com/me_jango","imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1414958948189413395/l89bNR2m_400x400.jpg","key":"jango"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"juicebox-roadmap-8-3-2021","title":"JuiceboxDAO Roadmap 8/3/2021","authors":["jango"],"tags":["observations","dao"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Juicebox Observations 8/3/2021","permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-observations-8-3-2021"},"nextItem":{"title":"Juicebox Governance","permalink":"/zh/blog/juicebox-governance"}},"content":"From my point of view, JuiceboxDAO has only a handful of big-picture initiatives to focus our efforts on over the next while:\\n\\n- Be available to help founders and communities get started with the Juicebox protocol with confidence. This includes creating more education materials and improving technical documentation. \\n- Build community analytics dashboards so communities can see how funding cycle reconfigurations have impacted their treasury over time, and so they can make better decisions into the future. This will also be useful so communities can cross reference decisions previously made by other Juicebox projects before making a similar decision themselves. \\n- Build L2 payment terminals so projects can receive funds on various Ethereum L2s (Optimism, Arbitrum, ZKSync, etc). I\'ve designed the general structure of this mechanism, but it needs to be implemented.\\n- As more projects choose to manage their treasury using the Juicebox protocol, the protocol\'s TerminalV1 contract will become responsible for securing an increasing amount of ETH. It will be possible for JuiceboxDAO to write and publish a TerminalV2 contract for projects to migrate onto that sends idle overflowed ETH to a yield earning vault. This will introduce a new risk vector, so this effort can wait until the protocol has matured and the expected return is favorable.\\n- Organize the JuiceboxDAO\'s [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6jXrJSyDFf) and the DAO\'s voting mechanics on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/), and continue providing structure and financial support to incoming contributors.\\n- Decentralize power over the JuiceboxDAO\'s governance over time by installing funding cycle ballots that rely on a more trustless execution of the outcome.

In the interactive model, `o` is the current amount of overflow, `s` is the currently total supply of tokens, and `r` is the bonding curve. The `x-axis` is the amount of tokens being redeemed, and the `y-axis` is the amount of overflow that can be claimed by redeeming the `x-axis` amount.\\n\\nA 60% curve thus means that one JBX can be redeemed (burned) for a little over 0.6 times its proportional value of JuiceboxDAO\'s overflow. For example, If you owned 1% of all JBX and there was 100 ETH of overflow, redeeming all of your JBX would earn you about 0.6 ETH.\\n\\nIn effect, a bonding curve creates an incentive to hodl tokens longer than others. The lower the bonding curve, the more this effect becomes exaggerated. The curve does nothing if there is no overflow.\\n\\nThe rate of 60% that we deployed with is somewhat arbitrary \u2013 we had no expectations for overflow anyways.

The rates are compounded over time, meaning a constant rate of 10% over two funding cycles would make the relative discount between contributions on either end 81% (10% of 100 is 90. 10% of 90 is 9. 100 - 10 - 9 = 81).\\n\\nThe discount rate is mega powerful and has lasting effects. It should not be used arbitrarily. \\n\\nOur reasoning for going with the max of 20% is that there\'s inherently much more risk to funding the project at its onset \u2013 the protocol is raw and untested in the wild, there are no trends to latch on to for financial speculation, and there are lots of unanswered questions still floating around. Any contributions made during this funding cycle are risky. We wanted to reward them as much as possible.\\n\\nWe plan on proposing a reduction of this rate to 10% for the next funding cycle, 5% for the following cycle, and settle on a constant rate of 0.5-3% from then on to keep a slight constant pressure to fund the project sooner rather than later. Expect this schedule to be reevaluated over time, but the philosophy behind its purpose as a risk offset to hold true.\\n\\nNotice: Each project built using the Juicebox protocol as its treasury pays a standard 5% fee from its payouts to the JuiceboxDAO. This fee is treated like every other payment made, so each project receives JBX tokens in return. The discount rate thus also gives projects an incentive to compose with Juicebox sooner rather than later."},{"id":"is-juicebox-for-whales","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/is-juicebox-for-whales","editUrl":"https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs-v2/blob/main/blog/2021-07-27-is-juicebox-for-whales/index.md","source":"@site/i18n/zh/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2021-07-27-is-juicebox-for-whales/index.md","title":"Juicebox

You can begin using Juicebox as your project\'s payment terminal with one gas-efficient transaction.\\n![](image-1.png)A project running on Juicebox.\\n### Motivation\\n\\nLong story short: indie artists and devs, DAOs, and public goods more generally, need a groovy way to capture the value they create, make reliable cashflow money out of it, and then share it back into the world. \\n\\nThe Juicebox protocol does this by allowing projects to make commitments about how its cashflow will be distributed *before *ever receiving payments, signaling to users how their money will be spent ahead of time*. *It works really well as a payment terminal and programmable treasury for projects that have mostly predictable costs (like staff payouts, service subscriptions, donations, budgeted initiatives, etc.), and who want to automatically reward their community as they become successful.\\n\\n![](Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-12.00.04-PM.png)\\n### How it works\\n\\nWith just one gas-efficient transaction, you can start funding and growing a Juicebox project, and configuring its treasury\'s payouts.\\n\\nOnce deployed, anyone can fund your project either as a patron by making a payment directly through [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money), or by using other contracts that take fees composably into the Juicebox protocol. Either way, they\'ll receive your project\'s community tokens in return.\\n![](Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.03.07-PM.png)People can pay you directly via an interface like [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money).![](Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-1.24.21-PM.png)Or, inherit from `JuiceboxProject.sol` and use `_takeFee` to get paid contractually.\\nAs the project owner, you can set a funding target that specifies how much it\'ll cost to create and operate your project for a set amount of time. You do this *before* anyone sends you money. If your project earns more than its funding target in a set period of time, the overflow can be redeemed by your supporters alongside you in exchange for burning tokens. This effectively pushes everyone\'s price to pay for your project towards zero as usage grows.\\n\\nIf left unclaimed, overflow serves as a runway for projects.\\n\\nA project\'s team and its community are thus incentivized to work together to make sure overflow growth outpaces spending.\\n![](image-2.png)\\nFunding cycles roll over automatically, allowing people and contracts to affordably fund projects that are important to them on an ongoing basis.\\n\\nYou can configure a discount rate to incentivize earlier adopters, a bonding curve rate to incentive commitment from community members, and a reserved rate to receive some of your own tokens each time someone pays you and receives tokens themselves.\\n![](image-3.png)\\nProject owners can re-asses their funding needs and cycle configuration over time, and can choose to take their token holders\' perspectives into account while publishing these sorts of changes to Juicebox.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThere are several ways to configure your Juicebox projects. Here are few cool things you can do:\\n\\n1. You can route your income stream through the Juicebox contracts.\\n\\nFor example, you can make a version of Uniswap that explicitly only needs **$X** per month to be sustainably run (labor, ops), where each swap transaction incurs a fee **($Y)** that goes towards sustaining the service. If there are enough swaps that month **(N)** such that **N * $Y > $X**, then for each subsequent swap, all accounts that have swapped (and therefor paid fees) receive a dividend from the overflowed revenue that is proportional to the amount they\'ve contributed to the project\'s sustainability thus far. So if **N * $Y** grows unjustifiably faster than **$X** \u2014 which is the underlying market rent-seeking inefficiency that Juicebox projects try to out-compete \u2014 then instead of compounded shareholder wealth aggregation, everyone\'s price tends towards zero.\\n\\nMeaning people get a nearly-free, community-driven product with no ads, guaranteed data integrity, full business operation accountability, and an open source code base that runs reliably. All built by motivated punks that are getting paid what they ask for and are rewarded alongside the community as overflow grows.\\n2. It\'s easy to program financial dependencies, so your Juicebox project\'s funding target can be contractually hooked up to those of people and projects it depends on.\\n3. You can run a recurring/one-time fundraising campaign and return extra funds to your community, or to other causes.\\n4. As the project owner, you can earn some of your own tokens with every payment you receives. You\'ll \\"unlock\\" these tokens at the rate with which your overflow grows, not according to some arbitrary multi-year vesting schedule. These reserved tokens can then be contractually distributed to staff, or to other causes.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThere\'s nothing more exciting than working on/with/for the Ethereum ecosystem these days \u2013 new artful minds are being welcomed into cryptowallet-life everyday, and brilliant experiments are being crafted on the regular. It\'s a creator\'s dream \u2013 there\'s no need to manage infrastructure, \xa0growth is driven by your community, and financial expectations can be anchored down by code. The Juicebox protocol was created as a means to further this end. \\n\\nIf you have questions or want to contribute, don\'t hesitate to [hop into the Discord](https://discord.gg/6jXrJSyDFf)."}]}')}}]);
