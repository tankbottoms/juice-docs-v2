It was me and him and 2 other peeps on Clubhouse, and I was like this is stupid, no way this is gonna happen. As I got more comfortable in the DAO space, I eventually found my way to SharkDAO. I had started seeing these SharkDAO logos and I figured hey, I have a printing shop, I should make some hoodies with logos on them to give away, and I did (and they were expensive!). Jango and nicholas were people who helped guide me through sending out those hoodies, and so I got to know them and got to know JB. I decided to start making some JB clothing with graphics as well, and eventually I got put together with Zeugh and the talk was about community. I started helping wherever help was needed, like with governance, moving proposals along as they were coming in, etc. Eventually filipv jumped in and we started tag-teaming it and doing the podcast, which ran for a while."),(0,n.kt)("h3",{id:"filipv-is-great-is-it-fair-to-call-you-two-the-gruesome-twosome"},"Filipv is great.

I found myself in the front-end chat more and more (I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m providing value there\u2013 I hope I am!) to try to test various things, launch projects on test net, find obscure bugs that are here and there and provide suggestions/feedback based on what the onboarding calls are giving me, so it\u2019s kind of become a merged roll.

Since I joined JB I\u2019ve always felt the need to kind of protect the jangos of JB because they\u2019re so hyper focused that distractions can lead to mistakes, and that can be a big problem.

It\u2019s all about minimizing distraction.

If you are distracted about the outcome of something, you\u2019re taking away energy from the task that you\u2019re actually doing, and in athletics that could be the difference between a win and a loss, a championship and coming in second. It sounds super corny but launching new extensions has become that for me\u2013 that\u2019s the championship, we gotta get there, how do we get there, how do we stay focused are the questions I have bouncing around in my head.
