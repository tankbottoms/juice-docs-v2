class="hash-link" href="#wtf-are-nouns" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Nouns is an on-chain generative NFT project and experiment in community building through avatars. Nouns are 32x32 pixel characters with heads that represent a noun like “igloo,” “skateboard,” or “peanut.” One Noun is auctioned every twenty-four hours, forever, with all proceeds going to the Nouns treasury. When one auction is settled, the next Noun is generated and a new auction begins. Each Noun is entitled to one vote in Nouns DAO governance which decides how the treasury should be used.  </p><p>Auction bids for Nouns can easily reach over 100 ETH. As a result, owning a Noun is often limited to those that can afford to win these competitive auctions… unless you’re a member of SharkDAO ⌐◨-◨  </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sharkdao-a-shiver-of-nouns-enthusiasts-">SharkDAO, a shiver of Nouns enthusiasts 🦈<a class="hash-link" href="#sharkdao-a-shiver-of-nouns-enthusiasts-" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Did you know that a group of sharks is called a shiver?

Since Nouns has no roadmap from the Nounders (founders), Nouns is community-owned which gives power to holders to propose initiatives and decide how to use treasury funds. In other words, the task of building community and shaping the future of Nouns belongs to community members who hold Nouns, rather than the founders. SharkDAO, as one of only a handful of sub-DAOs within Nouns DAO, is one of the groups building this roadmap on-the-fly.</p><blockquote><p>“In short, sub-DAOs participation in a DAO is shaping and contributing a voice to that community so that the best ideas get surfaced, voted on, and make an impact in the world.”</p></blockquote><p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/dropnerdETH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropnerd</a></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="SharkDAO and NounsDAO infographic from sharsk.wtf" src="/zh/assets/images/sharkdao-infographic-fab5b06c2afd5139de3246d234491e69.png" width="2003" height="1052" class="img_ev3q">  </p><p class="subtitle">SharkDAO and NounsDAO visualization from <a href="https://sharks.wtf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sharks.wtf</a></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sharkdao-the-meme-that-jumped-from-rinkeby-to-mainnet">SharkDAO, the meme that jumped from Rinkeby to mainnet<a class="hash-link" href="#sharkdao-the-meme-that-jumped-from-rinkeby-to-mainnet" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>It all started with a small group of frens helping Nouns DAO test out their auction mechanism before it went live. <a href="https://twitter.com/Goldypix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goldy</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/punk4156" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4156</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dropnerdETH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropnerd</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/LithiumXBT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lithium</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kenbot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenbot</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/iamDelPiero" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Del Piero</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/eldefijesus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Defi Jesus</a> were a few of these early swimmers.

Over the next 24 hours the bidding quickly went past Ξ100 and then Ξ200 soon after. It became clear that the price of Noun 47 was going to swim past most Nouns auctions, apart from the very first Noun that sold for Ξ600. After their penultimate bid of Ξ244.82, SharkDAO was getting pretty close to exhausting the amount that they set aside for the auction.

title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>I spent the majority of my childhood exploring the internet and playing classic computer games like <em>Age of the Empires</em>, <em>The Secret of Monkey Island</em>, and especially <em>The Sims</em>. For hours and hours I would build, design, and arrange anything I could think up. Unbound by the limits of gravity, money, or even common sense, <em>The Sims</em> was an excuse to imagine what was possible rather than what was realistic. At the time this maybe seemed like a silly diversion, but like many of our early internet activities this turned out to be great practice for the future that was hurdling towards us. Spending hours customizing a Myspace page was, in retrospect, a great introduction to frontend development. And perhaps The Sims was the perfect introduction to metaverse architecture.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Old Town, The Sims" src="/zh/assets/images/old-town-ea86a9134cb5edd263f914e755c8597f.png" width="800" height="600" class="img_ev3q"></p><p class="subtitle">Old Town in The Sims (2000)</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lexicon-devils-origin-story">Lexicon Devils origin story<a class="hash-link" href="#lexicon-devils-origin-story" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://juicebox.money/#/p/lexicondevils" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lexicon Devils</a>, named after an EP by LA punk rock band Germs, is a guild of metaverse builders architecting virtual experiences in Voxels, Substrata, and beyond. They acquire parcels, design and execute complex builds, and organize interactive events including DJ sets, treasure hunts, parades, art exhibitions, and performances.</p><p>Around the time that Shark DAO was making waves, <a href="https://twitter.com/peace_node" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peacenode</a> got a call from <a href="https://twitter.com/I_AM_STAV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stav</a> and started chatting with <a href="https://twitter.com/nnnnicholas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicholas</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dropnerdETH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropnerd</a> about this “beautiful infrastructure layer of the internet that we’re all building on Ethereum.” One thing led to another and <a href="https://twitter.com/peace_node" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peacenode</a> was soon talking with <a href="https://twitter.com/Mieos_ETH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mieos</a> from <a href="https://juicebox.money/#/p/wagmistudios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WAGMI Studios</a> about a cross-DAO collaboration to create a Juicebox metaverse experience and the rest is history.</p><blockquote><p>I’ll never forget meeting Wacko, he was rocking the most insane wearables every 30 seconds. We just had to ask if he could join us and put him on the payroll.</p><p>— Peacenode</p></blockquote><p>Rather than sending funds p2p, Peacenode explained that the <a href="https://juicebox.money/#/p/lexicondevils" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lexicon Devils project on Juicebox</a> would issue payouts to a team of contributors on a set schedule. In other words: “I know you don’t know us, but let’s hang out.” Building in the open with a trustless, transparent treasury means easily building friendships and communities regardless of identity or credentials. Find your community, bring the good vibes.</p><p>And who knows, you might even end up making an ultra tropical banana-themed learning center complete with an animated gondolier.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The first iteration of the Juicebar and Juicebox Learning Center" src="/zh/assets/images/juicebox-v1-79e1ef4f8b0c977a672a77ec2de20e84.jpg" width="5212" height="1558" class="img_ev3q"></p><p class="subtitle">The first iteration of the Juicebar and Juicebox Learning Center</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-home-for-banny-iterations-of-the-juicebox-parcel-in-voxels">A home for Banny: iterations of the Juicebox parcel in Voxels<a class="hash-link" href="#a-home-for-banny-iterations-of-the-juicebox-parcel-in-voxels" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>v1 of the Juicebar was built as a home for Banny, the iconic blunt-smoking banana mascot of Juicebox. It was also home to the Juicebox Learning Center, a juicy and playful institution where visitors could watch videos about the protocol, learn terms in the glossary, and participate in ongoing JB events. This tropical parcel quickly became an oasis for long-time Banny devotees and newcomers alike to learn more about the crypto crowdfunding protocol that enables anyone to fund the “thing” of their dreams on Ethereum.</p><p>As part of the growing bannyverse, <a href="https://juicebox.money/#/p/wagmistudios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WAGMI Studios</a> and <a href="https://juicebox.money/#/p/lexicondevils" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lexicon Devils</a> organized the first ever JB metaverse treasure hunt with clues that make up a seed phrase… <em>but only with the help of a decoder</em>.

Not all communities are created equal, and many of them struggle to find their footing in the hustle and bustle of web3.</p><p>Finding good community members isn’t easy, but keeping them in the long run can be even harder. If your DAO has no way to compensate good community members or suffers from lack of coordinate or mission-alignment issues, you will likely find qualified people sticking around briefly and moving on. Consider thinking carefully about your mission and about a way to make it enthralling for new members. Sell the idea, and show how that idea will benefit your contributors or the planet at large. Don’t be afraid to say no, and have your mission well thought-out before you open a discord and start trying to attract new members.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="decide-on-governance-that-works-now">Decide on governance that works NOW<a class="hash-link" href="#decide-on-governance-that-works-now" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Many different <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/great-web3-governance-at-a-glance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">governance</a> systems exist, including 1-member-1-vote, quadratic voting, voting-by-tokens-held, and many more. Think carefully about how you’d like your own DAO to operate. Do you want everyone to have equal participation and inclusion? Then perhaps one-member-one-vote is the way to go. Or do you want certain members to have voting power because they are part of a core group? Do you want votes to pass with a 51% majority, or higher?</p><p>These are all important questions to consider. If you want a DAO that is more resistant to change, you may consider putting a voting threshold very high, for instance around 75% or above. This would ensure that only when the vast majority of your members agree on something that it will change.</p><p>If you want your DAO to morph quickly with changing times, you may decide to drop your voting threshold lower than 50%. This can also open you open to having your DAO hijacked by an influx of new members, so beware!</p><p>Regarding votes, how do you want people’s voting power to be represented? If you want to vote by tokens-held, then you are effectively allowing the wealthy to have greater voting power than the less wealthy. There is an argument here that the wealthy, who have invested the most in your project, deserve more voting power because they have more to lose. But new members entering your project may feel like voting is futile if they are eclipsed by others with outized voting power.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dont-be-afraid-to-adapt-as-you-scale-up">Don’t be afraid to adapt as you scale up<a class="hash-link" href="#dont-be-afraid-to-adapt-as-you-scale-up" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Consider what system you need right now, and be open to changing it. Regarding governance: If you are a small community with a core team, you may say that one-member-one-vote is the way to go. Do what makes sense at the time. If your project grows and you see another voting mechanism being more fruitful, go through the motions and suggest a change. Voting mechanisms are not set in stone, and shouldn’t be. Your DAO needs to adapt with the changing circumstances it finds itself in.</p><p>Regarding your discord server, Telegram or other service, consider changing it as your needs change. If your discord channels end up getting outdated, don’t be afraid to archive them. If your new members are getting lost in the onboarding process, consider adapting your process to be more open to new faces. Remember that by the time you start to grow, your DAO will be something you start to understand much more easily than a new member just coming in. It’s easy to lose sight of that perspective, so keep in mind to keep it simple and direct.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="and-most-importantly">And most importantly…<a class="hash-link" href="#and-most-importantly" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Have fun! You are engaging in something new, and in a great human experiment! Issues around governance have plagued humanity for thousands of years, and now with the advent of blockchain technology we have yet another style of governance to play with.

For thousands of years civilizations have attempted to crack this pesky conundrum, and arguably we’ve gotten a bit better at it. But has anyone truly solved governance? When we look at the instability in our history, it’s hard to say we have.</p><p>With blockchain and decentralization, a new movement has emerged to try to demonstrate what proper governance can look like. The <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/daolicious-tips-for-starting-your-first-dao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DAO</a>, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is one of many new attempts to organize human beings in a way that is conducive to efficiently and happiness. <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/the-power-of-tokenomics-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tokenomics</a>— a unique staple in web3 organizations— potentially hold the power to reinvent governance as we know it. So what’s the best system?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="community-as-the-core-of-great-governance">Community as the core of great governance<a class="hash-link" href="#community-as-the-core-of-great-governance" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>The short answer is: we don’t know. There are still total intangibles to governance that seem to elude our planning. Let’s take a look at the United States’ governance as an example.</p><p>Many people will point to the United States, a representative democracy, as an example of an effective governance system. Consider, however, that early on in the forming of that government, the first president, George Washington, was given free reign to control the government as he saw fit. He could have declared himself a king, and in fact it was his completely voluntary precedents that determined much of how the government matured in subsequent years.</p><p>Most people would agree that this kind of noble behavior is what shaped the United States toward democracy, and that Washington single-handedly could have given himself supreme power but chose not to. So this begs the question: how do we find the George Washington’s in web3? Where are the builders who will willingly take a back seat to allow an organization to grow?</p><p>And this is where community comes into play. A strong community with shared values and interests is one way to ensure that your members will look out for one another. George Washington has just gone through a war, and was thinking of what great sacrifices took place so that this new government could form. He was surrounded by soldiers and generals and statesmen who had gone through something similar. His incentive was to improve community, not hijack it.</p><p>What does the web3 analogue look like? That’s hard to say. A quick look at some of <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/juicebox-the-token-minting-powerhouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicebox</a>’s governance systems will show why we believe that are some tangibles, however, that can point you in the right direction.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="transparency-is-key">Transparency is key<a class="hash-link" href="#transparency-is-key" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>web3 is paradoxical in more ways than one. Perhaps at its core, however, is the idea that transparency is key. No backdoor deals, and everything can can be audited if one wishes.</p><p>This system dovetails with the themes of trustlessness we see all over blockchain discussions. If I’m regularly doing backroom deals, in the traditional world I would need your trust to let me keep doing that. How do you know I’m not abusing that trust? You don’t. In the web3 world, I have to have my dealings out in the open. Now, I don’t care if you trust me or not, because you can freely look at what I’m doing and, if it’s inappropriate, you can simple call attention to that.</p><p>Does this always work? No, of course not. But does it go a far way to establishing a shared value system? Yes. If everything is open, including payout distributions, proposals for how to change something, or partnership deals, then likely everyone will be on the same page about it. It also gives opportunity for structured disagreements, where hard questions can be asked.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bringing-it-all-together">Bringing it all together<a class="hash-link" href="#bringing-it-all-together" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>If anybody promises you that they have a system for finding the “George Washingtons” in your governance, run the other way. There is no sure-fire way to find the intangibles. What you can do, however, is structure your governance in a way that scares away the bad actors. Remember that your fifth columns only work when there are shadows, concealment, and graft at play. When you shine a bright light on everything, suddenly the environment is less conducive to trickery and value-misalignment (whether pernicious or well-intentioned). Keep that light shining bright, and don’t be afraid to speak your mind. You owe it to yourself and to your governance-compatriots.</p><p>Want more?

Starting a web3 business and you need to track your accounts payable/receivable? Juicebox can do that. Starting a nonprofit where you want to reward members with tokens for governance and participation? Juicebox can do that, too. Don’t quite know what you want to create, but you know you want a project that executes on-chain and has more tooling than anybody else in the game? Juicebox has you covered.</p><p>There are few web3 platforms out there that can help you create your own project and DAO, but none of them can do it with the ease and tooling that Juicebox can. Juicebox provides users with a platform to raise money, either as a one-time or on a recurring basis, all while also offering a suit of tokenomics tooling and token minting. If you don’t want tokens, no problem, you can use Juicebox like a simple programmable treasury to track donations, payments, profits (or “overflow” as you’ll come to learn), in a transparent and honest way. The days of opaque bookkeeping where contributors have to wonder exactly how their donations are spent are over.</p><p>Juicebox can be the backbone of a local school PTA tracking funds in and out, or it can (and has!) run multi-million dollar operations. It scales effortlessly and gives you tooling to create rich token-based voting economies, as well.</p><p>Perhaps most unique is Juicebox’s approach to what it calls “overflow”, which is money raised above your target amount. This money, which otherwise may be called “profit” and traditionally may go to executive payrolls or reinvestment, sits in a treasury and can be claimed by any holders of your token. The proportional claim of the treasury a token holder receives is completely set by you using a variety of tooling, and it incentivizes anyone participating in your project to want to see its success. It’s a great way to build a mission-aligned team and, should your project find success, it’s a way to effortlessly, transparently, and efficiently reward your team members and contributors.</p><p>Want more?

Token management is an area that every builder in the web3 space should take full advantage of; unfortunately, it’s also amongst the most neglected tools by new project creators.</p><p>At <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/juicebox-the-token-minting-powerhouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicebox</a>, we’ve created a robust and granular token management system that makes token management accessible for our project creators. We’ll delve into this tooling, along with the power of tokens in general. Read on the learn more!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="governance-and-so-much-more">Governance and so much more<a class="hash-link" href="#governance-and-so-much-more" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>One crucial aspect of token minting is how they relate to governance systems within <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/dalicious-tips-for-starting-your-first-dao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DAOs</a>s. While you may or may not be creating a DAO, you should keep in mind that these very same governance systems can also be used informally to gauge your stakeholder interests in an effective and efficient way.</p><p>You can choose to give tokens at your own discretion, or set certain metrics and tokenomic tooling to automatically generate and disburse tokens based on contributions made to your project. The Juicebox difference is in the rich tooling our platform provides project creators.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-lifecycle-of-a-token-built-on-the-juicebox-protocol">The lifecycle of a token built on the Juicebox protocol<a class="hash-link" href="#the-lifecycle-of-a-token-built-on-the-juicebox-protocol" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>How a token is used within the Juicebox protocol varies on a number of different factors and project creator settings. Let’s take a look at one particular path to help give you some insight into the lifecycle of an average token.</p><p>You’ve created a project, and you’ve set a distribution limit (how much funding your project needs in a given time frame to keep the lights on). Let’s say that every two weeks your project needs to be bringing in $5,000. That amount will cover the costs of the team and any other expenses to keep your project running smoothly.</p><p>Now let’s say somebody comes along and puts $2000 into your project. In exchange for contributing those funds, they get some amount of tokens (how many is completely determined by you). Furthermore, you may want to keep some tokens every time someone contributes funds, so you set something called a <em>reserved rate</em>, which is what percentage of tokens you keep. Let’s say you do 10%. So now 10% of all tokens created goes back to your project and sits in a treasury.</p><p>Now fast forward. Many more people have contributed to your project, and at this point your distribution limit is still $5000 every two weeks, but on average you’re taking in a lot more than that. All those extra funds sit in your treasury. Those “extra” funds are called your <em>overflow</em>.</p><p>Now let’s say one of your early investors, who has a lot of tokens for your project, wants to move on and get rid of his tokens. Rather than simply ignoring them, he can claim a percent of the overflow in your treasury proportional to how many tokens he has. If he has a lot of tokens, even though he may have initially just given you $2000 in funding, his tokens could be traded in for far more than that if your overflow is sufficiently large.</p><p>What’s unique about this system is that it incentivizes contributors to your project to 1) stick around, and 2) to be actively invested in your success. Some people will never be interested in trading in tokens; they may see more utility in using the tokens for governance, or simply hanging on to them as a trophy and receipt of their contributions to you. However, for those who are hoping to eventually cash out with more than they invested, the token redeeming exchange allows for this scenario if your project has become sufficiently successful.</p><p>Let’s say that first investor burns all his tokens, and gets back $3000. He’s made a profit of one thousand dollars. By redeeming the tokens, he has taken them out of circulation and they have been destroyed. He’s made $1000 in the exchange, and you managed to attract an investor early on when you needed funding more.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="an-overview-of-juicebox-tooling">An overview of Juicebox tooling<a class="hash-link" href="#an-overview-of-juicebox-tooling" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>Where Juicebox really shines is in its ability to give project creators full control over the tooling they wish to employ in their projects. There is a rich help section along with a glossary on info.juicebox.money, but for a brief overview read on to learn some of the basics.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="distribution-limit">Distribution Limit<a class="hash-link" href="#distribution-limit" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>The easiest way to think of this is by answering this question: how many funds do you need to keep the lights on for your project, and how frequently do you need them? Do you have a dev team that needs to be paid, or server hosting fees, a content writer, etc.? Whatever those costs amount to will tell you the amount of funds you need to keep your project stable and going forward.</p><p>Do you need $2000 every two weeks? $1000 every ten days? $5000 a month? Whatever time and amount you need is what you will declare as your “distribution limit” when you create a JB project.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="overflow">Overflow<a class="hash-link" href="#overflow" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>If your project receives more funds than you declared in your distribution limit, those extra funds will sit in a treasury. These extra funds are called overflow. Token holders can at any time redeem their tokens (trade in their tokens) for a portion of the value of overflow in your project. If your project has huge overflow because it has become very successful, then token holders can get a piece of that success by redeeming their tokens.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reserve-rate">Reserve Rate<a class="hash-link" href="#reserve-rate" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>The reserve rate is what percentage of tokens you keep every time you mint tokens. You can set this anywhere from zero to one hundred percent or in between. Setting a reserve rate allows your project to accrue tokens. Not having a reserve rate means that all tokens you mint will go to contributors.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="redemption-rate">Redemption Rate<a class="hash-link" href="#redemption-rate" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>The redemption rate is something you set that determines how much value redeemed tokens will have based on when they are redeemed. If somebody redeems their tokens right away, they will get less proportional overflow value than someone who waits until later to redeem their tokens. A redemption rate incentivizes people to stick around as your project grows, and it disincentivizes investors who are just looking to make a quick buck. You can set an aggressive or weak redemption rate, or none at all, when you create a Juicebox project.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="weight">Weight<a class="hash-link" href="#weight" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>The term <em>weight</em> simply means how many tokens or other assets, such as NFTs, a contributor will receive for a set amount of contribution. For instance, a contributor who puts $1000 into your project may receive a million tokens (if you so choose).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="burning-versus-redeeming-tokens">Burning versus Redeeming tokens<a class="hash-link" href="#burning-versus-redeeming-tokens" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Whenever someone gives back their tokens, those tokens are destroyed permanently. If a token holder gives back tokens for a share of the overflow, we call this “redeeming” the tokens. Let’s say, however, that there is no overflow. In that case, the tokens are still traded in and destroyed, but they don’t yield any value back. When this happens, we call it “burning” tokens.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together<a class="hash-link" href="#putting-it-all-together" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>The importance of JB really sits with the excellent tooling suite you receive by using it.

So for the last few funding Cycles, we&#x27;ve been operating in two experiments, which has been really great. These align with the Juicebox funding Cycles, I&#x27;ll drop a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/jbx-protocol/projects/1/views/20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> in the town hall chat for those who haven&#x27;t seen it before. So we&#x27;re basically scheduling issues every two weeks that is aligned with the JuiceboxDAO funding cycle. And I think what we&#x27;re going to plan to do is to give a recap of the previous funding cycle every two weeks. So next week, we&#x27;ll give a recap of all the stuff that was done in the last two weeks, which is going to be really really great this time around there&#x27;s been so much done. So definitely don&#x27;t want to miss that. </p><p>I want to highlight one quick fun feature. That was merged yesterday. So this is the ability to add Banny stickers to Memos, which is a small thing, but potentially a fun feature which some of you have been enjoying. So thank you for everyone who worked on that particularly JohnnyD who led the implementation. Check <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnnyD_eth/status/1536600334507843586" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JohnnD&#x27;s twitter</a> for a video demo of this.</p><p>There&#x27;s four big things in flight at the moment. And I&#x27;ll list them out in order of the time that they&#x27;ll be shipped more or less. </p><ol><li>The first is giving projects the ability to relaunch on V2 and giving token holders the ability to migrate their tokens to the V2 project.</li><li>Second is V2 project handles, which is being led by Peri. Right now projects on V2 don&#x27;t have handles like they did in V1 so that is adding support for those. </li><li>The third is NFT rewards for projects. Essentially it&#x27;s giving projects the ability to specify like if you contribute a certain amount of funds to this project, then we will reward you with an NFT. So that&#x27;s going to be really exciting giving projects another avenue to get funding which is great. </li><li>And then the fourth is obviously veBanny and staking.</li></ol><p>So I will quicking give an overview of what&#x27;s in store with V1 V2 migration, basically we need to give V1 projects the ability to relaunch on V2. So the canonical example is juiceboxDAO. We&#x27;re a V1 projects. We also now have a V2 project but none of our funds are in the V2 project.</p><p>What&#x27;s gonna happen is the projects will re-launch on V2, JuiceboxDAO has already done that so we have a project on V2. They&#x27;re then gonna move their whole balance to the V2 project. They&#x27;re going to add another payment terminal to the V2 project, and this is a special payment terminal where it&#x27;ll accept a V1 token and then return the V2 token in a 1:1 exchange rate.</p><p>So basically if I have Juicebox V1 token, there&#x27;ll be a place in the interface to go to swap my V1 tokens for the new V2 tokens. And that&#x27;s pretty much it. So the contracts are more or less done. Thank you to jango Dr.Gorilla and whoever else worked on that. That was really quick turnaround. And now it&#x27;s pretty much up to the front end to get the UI done for all of what I just explained. And then we&#x27;ll finally have upgrade path to some V1 projects to get on V2 and use all the cool new stuff. </p><p><strong>@peri</strong>: I think as everybody knows we still aren&#x27;t supporting project handles for the new V2 projects. And this is basically just has to do with some of the changes that are made in the contracts. We used to store a handle for a project on chain and it requires a lot of extra finessing in the contracts because we had to make sure that people can use the same contract and that handles could be transferred and reserved for certain period of time and claimed, there&#x27;s a lot of functionalities to bake in. So with the V2 project contracts, we just skipped over all that because it ended up not being very necessary for the functionality of the contracts themselves. But the downside of course is that it&#x27;s really nice to have in the app to be able to look up projects and search for projects.</p><p>So we&#x27;ve been working on another layer, another contract to add into the existing contracts that will support handles for V2 projects. It is not quite finished and it&#x27;s not on mainnet yet.  But we do have everything kind of functionally together so I can give a demo of how it&#x27;ll work in the app and explain how it works pretty quickly.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/zh/assets/images/njwILOI-d2fd6e7b5384dbdd906a0c382e8540e1.png" width="1280" height="1438" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><em>(screen sharing ongoing)</em></p><p>So I&#x27;ve got this empty project here on Rinkeby, ID 4117.  And we are going to set a handle for this project. </p><p>We&#x27;ve got a two-transaction-process for setting a project handle. And so the way that this works is we decided to use ENS names to handle the uniqueness of project handles what I mentioned earlier for making sure that handles be passed around and exchanged. There&#x27;s a lot of complexity there that ENS has already solved really beautifully and so we built the system around ENS names. The idea here is that if you want to use a handle for a project you will need to own the matching ENS name. So for example, I just got this ENS name on rinkby testinginprod.eth and this would allow me to set the handle of this project to testinginprod. So I&#x27;m gonna do two steps here,</p><ol><li>I have to own this ENS name first of course,  I&#x27;m going to set the ENS name testinginprod.eth and this would be one transaction. Once this completes, step one will be done.</li><li>The next step here is to actually set a text record on the ENS name. So if anybody&#x27;s used the ENS name app before you&#x27;ll know that you can come down and set these text records for any number of different things. We are using a particular key &quot;Juicebox project ID&quot;. You can come and set this property in the ENS name app manually if you want, but that&#x27;s a little bit of extra work. So we&#x27;ve made it nice, pretty and clean in the app and you can basically come down here and click this button and we&#x27;re gonna set that value in the ENS name text record to the ID of this project. So this one is 4117. So I&#x27;m going to send this transaction, which is the same as if I just came over here and just manually put 4117 here. That&#x27;ll show up here if you got the handle set up.</li></ol><p>Most importantly that&#x27;ll allow your project to be searched on the projects page. Right now the search bar works by searching for project handles and V2 projects don&#x27;t have handles you can&#x27;t search for them. It&#x27;s very lame that is now a thing of the past as soon as you set a handle for your project. Your project will be searchable. </p><p>An important thing to note is that either of these things change, for example if you were to transfer the ENS name and someone else changes that text record, your handle will go back to empty. So you have to have both of these things set constantly or if you were to change this to some other ENS name, your handle would go back to empty.</p><p>Another fun fact is you can also actually do subdomains here. </p><p>We will hopefully have that on mainnet this week. I&#x27;m pretty sure we&#x27;re doing. some just some last-minute things, but mostly everything is good to go. So expect it pretty soon. </p><p><strong>@0xSTVG:</strong> So does that mean that I could create multiple projects with subdomains of my ENS?</p><p><strong>@peri</strong>: You could. But you can&#x27;t have multiple projects using the same ENS name. So if you had like STVG.eth, and you want to do like one project one.STVG.eth and the other project two.STVG.eth, those could be two separate handles for different projects.</p><p>@mieos: Once we get that up and running, I think a screen recording of you going through that or WAGMI can put together a little infographic on what it is and how it works, especially when it gets up to the subdomain part, it&#x27;s just technical enough. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="vebanny-by-jmill">veBanny by @Jmill<a class="hash-link" href="#vebanny-by-jmill" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>I want to show a map with the veBanny stuff. I&#x27;ve been doing some work on the subgraph implementation to index the user tokens and interact with them. Right now we had a couple of big steps forward. One thing is there&#x27;s now a metadata file to parse for all the the characters or the variants so you can go through and scroll through the characters and figure out which one you want and then you can see them all in here, too. So that&#x27;s been a nice upgrade because you can pull that all from one place now.</p><p><em>(screen sharing ongoing)</em></p><p>So these are NFT positions that I&#x27;ve taken on this account. So you like lock positions that are actually coming from on chain. And then you can interact with them also, so I can do that to extend the lock or I can unlock the ones that have finished. So I can take this one and extend the lock like a thousand days. Then it takes a minute for the graph to re-index it, but it&#x27;ll show up 30 seconds later with the new lockdate.</p><p>And then other than that I showed this last week, we have a new contract where you can mint for one second just like test the unlock and redeem stuff. But yeah, I showed this on the last demo where you can  also like take a staking position and actually mint these things through the front end works also. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="quizz-time">quizz time:<a class="hash-link" href="#quizz-time" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="/zh/assets/images/AME442G-b0e7abeb37a8aa055a5a588739f9df56.png" width="954" height="515" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The answer is....</p><p><strong>Nicholas</strong></p><ul><li>As a student I made jewelry and garment. </li><li>I was a nationally ranked debater.</li><li>I haven&#x27;t been Malta before.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="nft-update-by-johnnyd">NFT update by @JohnnyD<a class="hash-link" href="#nft-update-by-johnnyd" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p><strong>@JohnnyD</strong>: I&#x27;ll just add a few sentences to what @aeolian has summarized before.

His work is plainly visible on our website, where he takes an active role both in the front-end code and, increasingly, in the design elements of the website. How visual architecture complements site tooling and functionality are an area of great interest and focus for him.

It’s been really good. Some good wins, we think, and some good projects to follow up on. We learned a lot about how to communicate our value proposition and got a lot of good stuff.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-important-heres-the-million-dollar-question-what-have-you-found-is-the-ideal-way-to-communicate-jbs-value-proposition">So important.

I think it’s really important to fish out what a project wants and what needs we’re there to give them. From there we’ll know what JB features that’ll help them the most— whether that be transparency in earning/spending, or the ease of launching an ERC-20 token and having that distributed to people upon contributing. Or whether automating payments out of the treasury and restricting/reconfigurations of that spending are the way they want to go. Those are the key points</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="it-strikes-me-a-scalability-problem-we-seem-to-have-a-boutique-approach-at-the-moment-almost-like-a-concierge-service-as-we-expand-how-do-we-streamline-some-of-that-onboarding-without-losing-that-conversation-with-the-user">It strikes me a scalability problem. We seem to have a boutique approach at the moment, almost like a concierge service. As we expand, how do we streamline some of that onboarding without losing that conversation with the user?<a class="hash-link" href="#it-strikes-me-a-scalability-problem-we-seem-to-have-a-boutique-approach-at-the-moment-almost-like-a-concierge-service-as-we-expand-how-do-we-streamline-some-of-that-onboarding-without-losing-that-conversation-with-the-user" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>You’ve hit the nail on the head, that’s absolutely what we have to focus on. I definitely have ideas around that; mainly I really like the idea of categorizing particular common projects/project types, like NFC Coops, straight up Web3 businesses, or the classic one-time fundraiser. I think having clear resources for these like links to pre-filled templates could be super helpful and useful. Essentially, we want people to come to the site and feel comfortable setting up a project themselves without having someone walking them through it.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="for-sure-out-of-curiosity-what-was-it-like-gallivanting-around-with-zeugh">For sure.

It seems like they don’t quite see the scope of its use. What do you make of that?<a class="hash-link" href="#its-funny-arguably-the-most-powerful-jb-tool-the-treasury-seems-like-a-little-on-the-backburner-for-most-people-it-seems-like-they-dont-quite-see-the-scope-of-its-use-what-do-you-make-of-that" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Yeah exactly, there are so few projects using these treasury tools. I think it should be a big priority of ours to present it in a more understandable way; I’m keen to make it more visible on the front-end too. As great and flexible as the protocol is, it can be a tall order for people to understand.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="okay-now-on-to-your-origin-story-howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-it-changed-since-youve-been-here">Okay, now on to your origin story.

Before JB a group of friends and I started getting into NFTs and we wanted to create a DAO to be an NFT Coop, with the goal being to acquire some of the more expensive NFTs. Aeolian was one of my buddies in that NFT and he found JB and looked at the github, started working a bit on it, and told me about it. After a week or so I started doing the same. It was so exciting, I pretty much quit my job 2 weeks later and said okay, I’m doing this.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="front-end-seems-like-so-cross-disciplinary-youre-juggling-user-interfacedesign-along-with-coding-whats-that-like">Front-end seems like so cross-disciplinary.

Before JB it wasn’t a big part of my job at all. I would just get the designs and make it exactly as I was told. At JB I’ve enjoyed the challenge of just putting yourself in the user’s shoes and making it as smooth and seamless as possible.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thats-the-beauty-of-web3-isnt-it-if-you-want-to-take-something-on-and-you-are-capable-nobody-seems-to-care-whether-you-have-formal-training-degrees-etc">That’s the beauty of web3, isn’t it?

I would say it’s even more like that in the software industry than in most other industries. Web3 has taken that to a whole other level. It’s totally about what you can produce right now, not what you did a while back, or what you’re promising you’ll do in the future.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="speaking-of-the-future-whats-the-future-look-like-for-johnnyd">Speaking of the future— what’s the future look like for johnnyD?<a class="hash-link" href="#speaking-of-the-future-whats-the-future-look-like-for-johnnyd" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Front-end! I really like the front-end work process, and I’m becoming more inclined towards the design if anything, which is interesting. As much as I love development, really feel a passion for design building more and more.

Sage does some incredible art— that stuff is really inspiring. I remember coming to JB and just loving the vibes so much, there was just something so original about it.

Then the events themselves are also extremely challenging. I love the lifestyle of being well-rounded as opposed to just hammering away at one thing, and I think triathlons with a bit of gym work is probably the healthiest activity there is.
