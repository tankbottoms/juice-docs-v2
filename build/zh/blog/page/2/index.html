id="warning-of-influx-of-new-members">Warning of Influx of new members.<a class="hash-link" href="#warning-of-influx-of-new-members" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p><strong>filipv</strong>: On June 7^th^, the Discord server of JuiceboxDAO was faced with a big influx of new members from Indonesia. According to @Zeugh, they came from several big Telegram chat groups that are mainly focused on airdrops. There might be a misintrepretation that if they create a project on rinkeby.juicebox.money and give feedback in the Discord server, they will be entitiled to some kind of Juicebox airdrop. <strong>We don&#x27;t have any airdrop currently.</strong></p><p><strong>Zeugh</strong>： I think it won&#x27;t do any substantial harm to JuiceboxDAO, and think it a great opportunity to showcase the functionalities of our protocol to these people, and to onboard some new members who are really interested in our products.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="vebanny-front-end-updates-by-jmill">veBanny Front End updates by @Jmill<a class="hash-link" href="#vebanny-front-end-updates-by-jmill" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p><strong>Jmill</strong>: I have been working pretty extensively on the veBanny front end, trying to get it out the door. Now that the contracts are deployed, we can work to transactions and use real data.</p><p>(<em>sharing screen and demonstrating the process of staking tokens for an Locked NFT</em>)</p><p>So we&#x27;re now minting this thing through the website which is cool. The stuff is all working now, and show up pretty cool.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: I&#x27;ve also been on the contract side of things that @Viraz has been doing a great job, asking for reviews over the tests. The tests he&#x27;s writing and adding more fuzzing tests to the suite. So hopefully at this point, it&#x27;s throwing a lot of use cases at the cocept. And i suppose it&#x27;ll make way on to the actual final details to complete the workflow.</p><p><strong>Jmill</strong>: The big thing next is to read the onchain data and get the use of NFT, and then allow them to extend their locked positions on a particular NFT. All of those are related to fetching data, about multiple tokens. We&#x27;re talking about this in Peel&#x27;s Discord, and right now it&#x27;s implemented as ERC-721 Enumerable, but it&#x27;ll probably be easier if it were structured similiar with Juicebox projects where you have a directory structure and subgraph, to look that information up without recursive calls to open by index. So that&#x27;s probably what we need to start thinking about how we index these information for the purpose of front end to grab it and work with the data. </p><p><strong>jango</strong>: Yeah, that makes sense. Also from a juiceboxDAO or Juicebox perspective in Juicebox.money, we&#x27;ll possibly first have to deploy their staking contract and specify the lock duration they want etc. It isn&#x27;t going to be there for everyone first, they have to specify those things, so that that initial transaction to deploy a staking contract will go through a contract that somewhat serve as a directory or at least it&#x27;ll file an event that&#x27;s indexable to service a directory. If Peel and Juicebox.money feel it a decent thing to offer all projects over time and they should be able to interact with that same depolyer contract to get their own version of this.</p><p><strong>filipv</strong>:What&#x27;s the timeline looking like? Is that somehting we can expect deploying in the next month?</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: We need V1 &gt; V2 migration to do it for JuiceboxDAO. We can deploy this for an arbitrary project though. We can launch a new project and just has it work there, so you can start minting stuff, just as normal treasury and lock it there, at which point there&#x27;s not much difference between test and rinkeby as we currently are. But to get the JuiceboxDAO version of this and the Bannyverse version at least from a ecosystem perspective, we need to get V1 &gt; V2 migration, and then there might be other technical things along the way.</p><p><strong>Jmill</strong>: From a front end perspective, there are a couple of things that would be helpful so that there&#x27;s some kind of indexing data you can easily pull user&#x27;s NFT statistics. That&#x27;s a more simple and scalable way to do with subgraph query. It would be really usefull if the ve NFT contract deployer also deploy a single consolidated metadata file. Let&#x27;s say veBanny has 60 characters and they all have a name and staking ranges, it&#x27;ll be really nice that the contract generate that as one file that front end could grab and parse to display without going to 60 metadata files individually. That would be a quality-of-life thing from the contract side for the front end.</p><p><strong>tankbottoms</strong>: We could add another function for that metadata, basically something that will conform with an NFT but also has pointers to all assets you need, because you can pick them through the JSONs however you want.</p><p><strong>Jmill</strong>: The last item I have here is that we&#x27;re implementing beneficiary for this, so that users can stake and put someone else as the beneficiary.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: That&#x27;ll be useful for even a DAO to lock its supply, and designate other contributor or some other beneficiary for. It&#x27;s cool to have flexibility. The core thing being built allows everyone on the peripheral of the project to start to wrap their heads around what situation it&#x27;s gonna be when this thing is out there.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="product-prospective-with-zeugh">Product prospective with @Zeugh<a class="hash-link" href="#product-prospective-with-zeugh" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="/zh/assets/images/ktQrGSS-a6a1f2e23428f4842bea76122e9ce4af.png" width="1830" height="698" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>Zeugh</strong>: The Juicebox.money is a complex thing to use. I think it will be something to see that front end are more focused on some type of projects. Let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s a NFT project wants to launch its treasury on Juicebox, they can have a direct way for easy launch to help set it up ahead of time. You want to launch a NFT project and make the funds through Juicebox so people can co-own the treasury like tileDAO did and issue tokens for people that are minting.</p><p>Those are some of the configurations that we think we should do. That could be something like Juicebox.nft instead of Juicebox.money. And if you want to go to the hard mode and be able to configure every single thing, that&#x27;s still running on the same protocol.</p><p>That&#x27;s what I call the product prospective. We have a very good protocol perspective here that is building something really robust and can do lots of things. In the end looking at product level, maybe not all the users will need all of these things and having an easy way to launch might be something interesting.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: I think there&#x27;s a lot of to keep improving the onboarding stuff and especially we just came out of V2 trying to start with parity where V1 was. The name of the game now is just constant improving based on our own interest with onboarding as well as pulling together other people&#x27;s perspective. It&#x27;s hard to be certain that it&#x27;s one thing or another thing from my point of view, but without question we&#x27;re going to hinge towards better alternatives to prototypes that are massively useful. Shout out to JohnnyD and Aeolian and all the people in Peel who are eager and quick to make prototypes and start discord threads so that we can discuss the improvements. And then match this with a occasional AHA moment that a few different ideas come together that make sense to a lot of folks and somehow we unlock a lot more fluidity to the onboarding process. </p><p>I&#x27;m certainly with you that we have a lot of work to do with explaining what people are getting into, like starting with giving everyone all the information upfront and make all risks as clear as possible. Overtime we can start to reel back into some managable shortcuts. </p><p>I think now we&#x27;re definitely buckling for more long term investments both from a building perspective and the relationship perspective with other communities. I&#x27;m eager to see how that project chart changes over time. I think from my personal perspective and talking to projects, the recent lows haven&#x27;t been very encouraging for projects to launch. But now that V2 is out, we&#x27;re going to see a lot more of that.</p><p><strong>nicholas</strong>: When I did onboarding with Austin from BuildGuild and he had some feedback about simplifying. It&#x27;s a little bit difficult for someone on the outside to know exactly which simplifying approach will be successfull on the market aside from just iterating on simplifying the existing one. But I do have some suspicion that there are a larger category of people who are not so inclined to use Juicebox in its current form but might be inclined to do so for this example we&#x27;re talking couple of times about NFT collections, splitting off a portion of their primary and/or secondary to Juicebox and letting the holders manage it, which doodles, cryptopunks and a bunch of other projects already do. That&#x27;s a category I&#x27;m super interested in getting on the creation flow for that. It could be just like presets on what we&#x27;ve already got, or maybe an entirely separate creation flow where you can imagine entirely different front ends that just make creation really tight for a specific use case and then you can go use Juicebox.money&#x27;s full advanced front end and subsequently managing those things but make it easier for people to get onboard. It could be pretty integrated at Juicebox.money. There&#x27;s a lot to explore.</p><p><strong>filipv</strong>: One thng that we&#x27;ve discussed that might be interesting would be if there&#x27;s a way to easily import and export project configurations which Austin Griffith originally brought up, for exporting a project that was made on testnet to mainnet. That might be cool because you can use that feature to set up templates that have base project configurations.</p><p>Another thing I want to talk about is what we&#x27;re discussing a lot in the chat about amount of metrics. I&#x27;m not sure how useful focusing on any specific North Star metric would be. It&#x27;s very hard to encapsulate everything in Juicebox, and I think everything is conflating with each other. So I think we can take anything and roll with it, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worthy going super deep into which is the best North Star metric.</p><p><strong>Aeolian</strong>: I&#x27;m totally with @filipv. I think the goal I originally had with proposing this metric was not so much like &quot;ok! Let&#x27;s review this number every week!&quot; or &quot;Oh! it&#x27;s going down, what&#x27;s happening?&quot; It&#x27;s more like what we&#x27;re all in some sense collectively optimizing for everything from a product, website, documentation and content strategy, the whole thing. Our goal right now is to increase the number of active projects. I agree with you that at this stage where traffic is still very low, really trying to hatch out a metric that&#x27;s instructive right now. It&#x27;s more to get us all on the same page.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: I think the general consensus is that it feels good to have activity. I guess you could put on a chart and optimize for it, but personally I want to think about metrics that make me lean in more in moment&#x27;s notice seeing activities, and seeing folks I know engaging with other projects making me want to learn more about them.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="govenance-discussion">Govenance discussion<a class="hash-link" href="#govenance-discussion" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p><strong>@filipv</strong>: I want to open up some discussion on the recent governance cycle, both in itself and some of the proposals. </p><p>One thing I want to bring up first is the possibility of changing the governance cycle in order to allow for longer temperature checks because I definitely feel the temp check are too short. But there&#x27;s also balance if you lengthen the temp check, it makes it harder to get things through the governance process and it takes longer to get things done. We did a poll and people are really into the weekday idea.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/zh/assets/images/nG8Bn2D-7b9c7c25f95d53b41aefb6272167a809.png" width="772" height="668" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>nicholas</strong>: Since people prefer temp check ends during the week, I&#x27;d particularly like the proposal edit freeze to happen during the week, because I had to spend a lot of Sundays modifying proposals because people obviously just give comments leading up to the freeze and I prefer it end in the week. I understand people have jobs and I am certain that might not be convenient, but people from the poll seem to be happy with that idea.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: For me personally, it&#x27;s nice to end on weekend because I can do a lot more meeting oriented and dev oriented stuff during the week, and in the weekend, I can read the proposals and think about those. There&#x27;s not much weekend breaktime.</p><p><strong>nicholas</strong>: How specified should proposals be? I made a suggestion that is three points if you add them to the proposals,
<img loading="lazy" src="/zh/assets/images/GbRQJsd-14e72c17e289c704f7e2a262f74a288e.png" width="2020" height="946" class="img_ev3q">
maybe they will enable more delegation, because a lot of the burden getting the proposal through can be like knowing exactly what steps should be taken, when it&#x27;s not always necessary DAO knows every single steps if DAO is willing to accept the risks, the implementation risk of someone delegating it to the person who&#x27;s the author or someone specified in the proposal. I think it&#x27;s a decent choice if it&#x27;s a better financial allocation and also adding a risk in risk section which is like &quot;Look, we&#x27;re not specifying the address the money got set to, we don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a super important detail for the DAO to be voting on&quot;, but that&#x27;s a risk we can screw up sending it to a wrong address because it wasn&#x27;t specified in the proposal. It allow the proposal to move forward before all those details are sorted out. Some proposal do deserve to have hyper detailed specifications and it&#x27;s important for the DAO to vote on it, others delegation will be more appropriate. I think that might be a interesting format for making governance more manageable. </p><p><strong>filipv</strong>: I&#x27;m definitely onboard with that. I think that thing need to be weighted very carefully just because it&#x27;s not like we are going through a hierachy and people are revising it in every step. It&#x27;s kind of like every proposal goest to the multisig like the one source of truth. It&#x27;s like something running close to the middel very powerful and very dangerous. I think we need to be careful about specifications and and we don&#x27;t want to lead to some DAO crisis when people are disagreeing on an interpretation of the proposal after the fact.</p><p>First of all it waste a bunch of time, also people are gonna get upset and may lead to conflicts. So I am generally more of a stickler that we should have very specific proposals just because how dangerous it is. I wonder if there is a way to incentivize people to submit a bunch of proposals earlier so they can be spread out ever a greater period of time. We really see most proposal submitted close to the end of temp check. It&#x27;s not an easy question to solve.</p><p><strong>nicholas</strong>: Part of the challenge is the 14days cycle, if you would like to submit a proposal for something and temp check submission just opened, that means you  can no longer submit a proposal and you could be waiting for 20+ days till the next opportunity to vote. It may be worthwhile, for instance the bug bounty, I can see both sides on it, maybe a longer process allow us to consider, but at the same time, the protocol needs the bounty pretty badly. </p><p>I think it would be of some value not entirely in the direction of everything being specified because the reality is that just making through all of that governance and having opinions on it is stretching the limits of the bandwidth of even the most dedicated members of the DAO. It also becomes less decentralized the more because people are just voting along with other people who have already voted. There&#x27;s also some needs to us to recognize that actually the DAO doesn&#x27;t need to vote on every single details of everything, and some amount of delegation is probably gonna be necessary over the medium term. </p><p><strong>filipv</strong>: Two thoughts on that.</p><p>One is that I don&#x27;t see why we couldn&#x27;t do it right now like approving a budget in advance to reduce future governance overhead and go through that process. I think that&#x27;s very achievable and I&#x27;m interested in pursuing that.</p><p>Second thought is that jango has be mentioning lately the idea of possibly pursuing funding for projects and budgets for projects rather that fuding budgets for individuals or groups, which I think compelling because the structure of what we are doing shifts a lot and it&#x27;s the post V2 transitory period. So I wonder maybe a shift towards budgeting for things get done rather than having all these smaller individual small group proposals may accomplish what you are talking about being able to improve things in advance and delegates to someone who&#x27;s leading the project.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: Some of the treasury allocations have also been tricky in the past weeks because we&#x27;ve been tuning the treasury create stuff on and off while we address some protocol problem. Those should be made well in advance in proposals being specified to be directed towards them. I am definitely in the camp of more hyper specificity upfront and throughout the temp check process.</p><p><strong>filipv</strong>: Would you want to work with Juicebox if you didn&#x27;t get funding through an individual basis, but rather as a part of multiple projects?</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: The end of payment routing is still individual payout, either from a project that you control like what JohnnyD has, or through a direct payment from a project. The idea is that it&#x27;s just not managed by a conglomerate governance system.</p><p><strong>felixander</strong>: I want to talk with JohnnyD and Aeolian about this. What happens when you bring a human on for a projects and the project is solved? It doesn&#x27;t make sense for the system now because we&#x27;ve committed a budget to something that only took 2-3 months, but now somebody is there, but they&#x27;re taking on another work that might be totally separating them from what they&#x27;re doing. I think it&#x27;s something a little bit messy in terms of how the payment structure works presently.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: I feel that kind of work is really important when a project is starting out, that&#x27;s still the case now and will likely still be months into the future. There&#x27;s a lot happening and everyone is contributing to whatever the next person needs. So people are just shouting &quot;hey I got this dope thing in progress, it&#x27;d be sweet if I could have this ounce of help&quot; and luckily there&#x27;s a lot of people around who are eager and feeling supportive to do that work. So the individual payouts feel appropriate in that world.</p><p>I think that would set the expectation that there&#x27;s a lot of stuff that we&#x27;ve building isn&#x27;t just onging forever, we&#x27;re not hired by JuiceboxDAO to be here comfortably and feel valued imbued and viewed by our relationship to one another and to the concept of the projects. Once those projects play themselves out, I think it&#x27;s healthy to reassess what our purpose is amongst current state of the projects and how we can prepare ourselves for future state of uncertainty which are always upon us. That&#x27;s the thing we can almost guarantee. </p><p><strong>felixander</strong>: Would that be the same way like Peel, WAGMI and Canu, the idea that people would branch off like Peel now is under a budget to do front end? You could imagine people who are doing docs would branch out and have a budget, and people who are doing translation would also branch off and have a budget.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: I think that&#x27;s in a creative part and I&#x27;m sure everyone will bring their own taste of how to frame these things. It&#x27;s effective to pay Peel to work on the Juicebox.money project, front end developers can assess each other&#x27;s contributions and payouts better than any multidisciplinary group would.</p><p>These things will inevitably shift and change over time, as people come and go, as well as the projects changing. It&#x27;s tougher for the community to rationalize consistent budgeting for an abtract group of people with an abtract but pointed mission, the individuals are liquid between all these project organizaitons and we hve to respect that. People are going to find their leverage over time and they don&#x27;t owe anything to any organizations. We&#x27;re all just building ourselves out and learning from each other in  this whole process. I think we&#x27;re going to see a lot of different ways to organize it.</p><p>Shout out to Zom_Bae creating the Juicebox events version for the upcoming ice cream event and it&#x27;s in a potential to add more longevity to that concept. What if we&#x27;re to actually trying to fund events consistently and have a pool of resources that we can make this up every single time. We can just re-reference something that we know to be true already.</p><p>I think we&#x27;re on the same page eventually. We&#x27;ve got to create the right incentive model to shift away from building up the Juicebox foundation to supporting one in any numbers of projects and then servie it to the world and make it the gateway. But as the protocol tends towards stability, it&#x27;ll be great to have tighter articulation of what it means for a project to succeed over time.</p><p><strong>Aeolian</strong>: I do like what @casstoshi brought up about the idea of each group having a budget and individual contributors are paid from that budget. I think Peel has done this. At a time all the front end people were doing individual proposals to JuiceboxDAO and the sentiment was that it&#x27;s hard to evaluate these proposals. So intead JuiceboxDAO votes on a single budget for front end and that team can handle that budget as they see fit.</p><p>I&#x27;ll post a <a href="https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp68-modify-protocol-engineering-core-unit-budget-pe-001/13797" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> that Drgorilla posted earlier about how makerDAO manages this process where there&#x27;s a clear budget for each abstract collecton of people. It definitely breaks down as we&#x27;ve seen with some proposals over the last couple of weeks. It&#x27;s hard to pinpoint someone into one of those particular groups, people can work ver much across thses groups.</p><p>I still think it&#x27;s instrutive not only from accounting perspective but also from an organizational perspective, it just makes it easy to reason about someone&#x27;s payout if they&#x27;re clearly contributing to a specific area.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-highlights">Project highlights<a class="hash-link" href="#project-highlights" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p><strong>gogo</strong>: I&#x27;m very glad to be able to discover the future of ComicsDAO and strategy of what we&#x27;re gonna do there.

What I would like to propose is that this is our heroes Banny and they&#x27;re travelling throught the DAO galaxy to DAOs.

And so far you are all playing really well, well done.</p><p><strong>nicholas</strong>: There&#x27;re a bunch of really cool projects this week. JokeDAO just launched a super sick governance experimentation project. </p><p>Austin Griffith&#x27;s BuildGuild got launched this week and there&#x27;s a proposal to fund a hackathon for them to transform scaffold-eth into something compatible with Juicebox or to build the hackathon projects using scaffold-eth with juicebox involved in the picture. And as jango mentioned in  his twitter that Juicebox front end is based on scaffold-eth. </p><p>So it&#x27;s very cool to see comfort circle, and hopefully we will be able to fund a modest hackathon to get the treasury kickstarted with funds, hopefully getting that brew of hackers into the ecosystem. </p><p>@twodam&#x27;s has posted a twitter about this week&#x27;s projects <a href="https://twitter.com/twodam_eth/status/1534200052511518720" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

Thank you @nicholas for doing a lot. Most excited once we get the V1 V2 token stuff, situated to start talking to the SharkDAO, or a lot of folks operating on V1 still doing ongoing work and fundraising, to see if they want to move over and leverage some of the new tools to make their projects more successful, whatever that means to them these days.

What’re you up to right now and what’s on your mind?<a class="hash-link" href="#hey-mieos-whatre-you-up-to-right-now-and-whats-on-your-mind" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Hmm… the thing that has been occupying my attention and creativity a lot lately has been this desire to convert the greater portion of juicebox projects from these crowd-funded single-purchase projects to something more like a product or service or longer-term projects that build out and make full use of JB tooling.</p><p>It’s really also about trying to find a way for creators to run creative endeavors on web3 because they believe web3 is where we’re going, but may not be super comfortable with web3 yet. I feel like I’m really hunting down people who I know may be able to bridge this gap and show some excellent JB use cases.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-think-daos-are-still-new-enough-where-the-people-themselves-have-to-be-the-tools-almost-like-fleshy-uis-that-can-help-navigate-doers-who-may-not-be-fluent-or-even-conversational-in-the-web3-world-definitely-not-an-easy-person-to-find">I think DAOs are still new enough where the people themselves have to be the tools, almost like fleshy UIs that can help navigate doers who may not be fluent or even conversational in the web3 world. Definitely not an easy person to find.<a class="hash-link" href="#i-think-daos-are-still-new-enough-where-the-people-themselves-have-to-be-the-tools-almost-like-fleshy-uis-that-can-help-navigate-doers-who-may-not-be-fluent-or-even-conversational-in-the-web3-world-definitely-not-an-easy-person-to-find" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>No, haha, definitely not! We’re stuck in a beautiful moment where V2 is starting to open up an opportunity for non full-web3 nerds, whereas with V1 there really wasn’t much chance for non web3-nerds. V2 is starting to change that and I think that will lead to more great things.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-does-wagmi-fit-into-all-this">How does Wagmi fit into all this?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-does-wagmi-fit-into-all-this" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>I think Wagmi has to take a position of palatable education. I think good branding does that. It points people in the right direction for the kind of info they want. I’ve always wanted Wagmi to be more educational, but when we started to do this with V1, V2 was on the horizon so we held off. After all with all the changes coming with V2 it didn’t make sense to produce a lot of content that would all just have to be redone a few months later. Now that V2 is here and coming into its own, we can really go full force into this endeavor.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="for-what-its-worth-when-i-started-as-a-total-jb-n00b-the-wagmi-videos-were-really-the-easiest-entryway-to-me">For what it’s worth, when I started, as a total JB n00b, the Wagmi videos were really the easiest entryway to me.<a class="hash-link" href="#for-what-its-worth-when-i-started-as-a-total-jb-n00b-the-wagmi-videos-were-really-the-easiest-entryway-to-me" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Yeah and that’s what it’s about. We want creatives, people who may be a bit unclear on web3, but who see where its going and recognize its value. And those people will bring their supporters over. Making great content to help ease that transition into web3 is a biggie to attract those people.</p><p>In terms of Wagmi’s future, I’d ultimately love to see Wagmi move away from full-time JB stuff and move more toward helping projects on the platform succeed. We could give these projects a little shove in the creative department, whether by helping them with animations, designing mascots, and who knows what else.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ive-felt-like-jb-high-could-be-a-central-point-of-info-for-newbies-obviously-a-lot-of-that-exists-already-elsewhere-on-the-web-but-do-you-see-any-value-in-really-doing-like-a-web3-crash-course-on-jb-high-to-truly-onboard-a-total-n00b-from-starting-to-finishing-their-first-project-creation">I’ve felt like JB High could be a central point of info for newbies. Obviously a lot of that exists already elsewhere on the web, but do you see any value in really doing like a “web3 crash course” on JB High to truly onboard a total n00b from starting to finishing their first project creation?<a class="hash-link" href="#ive-felt-like-jb-high-could-be-a-central-point-of-info-for-newbies-obviously-a-lot-of-that-exists-already-elsewhere-on-the-web-but-do-you-see-any-value-in-really-doing-like-a-web3-crash-course-on-jb-high-to-truly-onboard-a-total-n00b-from-starting-to-finishing-their-first-project-creation" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>I don’t think it’s overkill to do that at all, we just have to be clear on our time cost, and we shouldn’t invest too much time if there are more efficient ways to do it. I think a web3 crash course could be done in 2-3 animated shorts plus maybe a page or two on JB High; it’s not a heavy lift.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-it-changed-since-youve-been-there">How’d you get started with JB, and how has it changed since you’ve been there?<a class="hash-link" href="#howd-you-get-started-with-jb-and-how-has-it-changed-since-youve-been-there" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>From the very beginning, I was trying to figure out from what JB could be. Jango’s take was that JB was a payment terminal, so I was like okay, are we building Stripe for web3? But then he was talking about treasuries, and discount rates and bonding curves, and pre-minting tokens and reserve rates, and I was like man, nobody’s gonna have any idea what this is. When I finally grokked it I was like “Ohhhh, this is what this could be!”</p><p>I saw some possible use cases, and was talking to some of the early guys about what it could do, but I think none of us really grasped it. It was so new and there just wasn’t really a concept you could build off, you really had to understand it for what it was, as something unique, and that took time.</p><p>But before even all that happened, I was working with Sage to figure out the brand and how we can we make this whole JB thing feel cool, and actually one of the first things we messed with was claymation.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-saw-a-claymation-video-floating-around-is-that-one-of-those-early-things">I saw a claymation video floating around! Is that one of those early things?<a class="hash-link" href="#i-saw-a-claymation-video-floating-around-is-that-one-of-those-early-things" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Yeah, that’s one of the first things Wagmi ever did! It was a lot of fun.</p><p>Another biggie early on, actually probably the first thing that came up as important, was starting to think was how could we help people understand what JB could do. So I figured “Oh, I could launch a project on JB and that could serve as an example for people of what to do.”</p><p>So I told Sage, hey, let’s run something like an animated studio/illustration studio out of JB, really as an example of JB’s power, and that was the birth of Wagmi. And it has been an absolutely great example. I’m really glad we did that rather than stay as paid contributors in JB itself. It serves as a great example for how projects can coexist in the space and serve one another.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="was-jb-your-first-jump-into-web3">Was JB your first jump into web3?<a class="hash-link" href="#was-jb-your-first-jump-into-web3" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Yeah, it was! I’ve just always been interested in tech projects and when I got to know jango and peri and they were talking about tech projects I just wanted to hang out and learn, and to try to help in any way I could.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="man-thats-such-a-high-bar-for-a-n00b-to-get-into">Man, that’s such a high bar for a n00b to get into.<a class="hash-link" href="#man-thats-such-a-high-bar-for-a-n00b-to-get-into" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Haha, yeah it was a high bar, I still remember it took me 4 months! I spent 4 months saying the words and having no idea what I was talking about— “Yeah yeah yeah, the payment terminal, and getting ETH out and bonding curve, and the redemption rate,” I had no idea what I was talking about, and then, finally one day it clicked! It was so rewarding, and it validated to me so much of what I had been trying to grasp.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-ran-into-that-in-a-very-dense-philosophy-text-once-that-was-like-that-so-hard-to-grasp-you-wanna-walk-away-since-you-definitely-dont-wanna-stick-around-and-feel-stupid-thats-a-tough-spot-to-be-in">I ran into that in a very dense philosophy text once that was like that. So hard to grasp, you wanna walk away, since you definitely don’t wanna stick around and feel stupid. That’s a tough spot to be in.<a class="hash-link" href="#i-ran-into-that-in-a-very-dense-philosophy-text-once-that-was-like-that-so-hard-to-grasp-you-wanna-walk-away-since-you-definitely-dont-wanna-stick-around-and-feel-stupid-thats-a-tough-spot-to-be-in" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Yeah! Sticking around and feeling stupid sucks. You want to help, you want to chip in, and halfway through a sentence you realize damn, I don’t know what I’m saying, but now I’ve started talking and I gotta finish this sentence, haha. It’s like the brain needs contextual points of knowledge to learn the next thing, and some things are so far away from these basic knowledge nodes that you can’t bridge the concept. Then you’re like “Oh, it’s like Uber for Mcdonalds?” and it clicks all of a sudden. But what if you don’t have that basic script where you have to really put two or three of those nodes together to bridge over to a new concept. Sometimes you have the right teacher and they know that’s the case, and they’ll build that out for you, but otherwise you’re kind of reinventing the wheel in your mind, and for sure that can be so frustrating.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="im-glad-it-clicked-for-you-and-for-me-whos-your-fav-contributor-and-why-is-it-stevie-g">I’m glad it clicked for you (and for me!).

I would say the thing that attracts me to Stevie G is his uncanny ability to come off as hyper-authentic. There’s never a moment where I listen to him that I’m not like, “This dude is so real, he’s like, such a good human.” Regardless of whether or not you are a good human, or you think you are, many times I come off as an asshole—</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="oh-yeah-you-dont-need-to-tell-me-coming-off-like-an-asshole-unintentionally-is-a-lowkey-superpower-of-mine">Oh yeah, you don’t need to tell me, coming off like an asshole unintentionally is a lowkey superpower of mine…<a class="hash-link" href="#oh-yeah-you-dont-need-to-tell-me-coming-off-like-an-asshole-unintentionally-is-a-lowkey-superpower-of-mine" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Hahaha!

Hmm… other than that, as a child I was forced to do Hooked on Phonics, it’s probably not funny for anybody under the age of 35 since it didn’t exist for anybody that young, but like, when I had to do it, it was a joke, it was literally a joke that people would say to diss each other.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-remember-that-it-was-a-schoolyard-way-to-call-people-dumb">I remember that… it was a schoolyard way to call people dumb.<a class="hash-link" href="#i-remember-that-it-was-a-schoolyard-way-to-call-people-dumb" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Right!

I was involved in SharkDAO and I got to meet some of the people there, and got to meet jango who was the lead protocol dev there. Eventually my interest turned primarily to JB. I’ve always been interested in these tools that allow for social integration and JB was right up that alley in terms of tooling that lets people coordinate to create whatever project they want. On top of that they have this X factor which is the spirit of a true DAO— it’s not about VC or cash grabs— and I think that’s really interesting given the last 20 years or so of centralized social development in web2.</p><p>I contributed at JB where I could, did a lot of governance, operations streamlining, starting tye notion library and working on organization. In early 2022 I decided to take a step back, focus a bit more on programming stuff, solidity, NFTs, etc. Over the course of a few months I realized I’m just too fascinated by JB, and especially with V2 coming out and seeing this amazing potential. JB feels like an open source project with a revenue model, which is attracting incredible people from all over the world.</p><p>So I decided to jump back into JB. I put proposal in for trial payout and I’m hoping I can jump back into the team.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="theres-a-lot-of-excitement-around-v2-what-specifically-has-you-interested-in-coming-back">There’s a lot of excitement around V2. What specifically has you interested in coming back?<a class="hash-link" href="#theres-a-lot-of-excitement-around-v2-what-specifically-has-you-interested-in-coming-back" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Two things are drawing me back— tankbottoms, who has been building/adapting stuff related to NFT creation and minting and turning those into tools that can be used more broadly. If it can be pulled off correctly, I think it’ll go way beyond just JB. It’s really revolutionary and applicable in so many different contexts. I feel like I can be useful there in design/code/helping out.</p><p>That’s obviously enabled partly by V2. The treasury management stuff being discussed right now— like creating projects that allow you to diversify the treasury into other tokens, and using JB as mechanism for doing that— is extremely cool. V2 is so open-ended, and part of the lift involved is getting that tooling across to people.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-think-thats-a-biggie-jb-has-so-many-tools-but-i-agree-that-it-may-be-overwhelming-for-a-newbie-coming-onto-the-scene-theres-also-a-kind-of-idea-like-if-you-spotted-a-restaurant-that-served-italian-japanese-greek-and-turkish-food-you-may-think-okay-they-cant-possibly-be-doing-all-that-correct-what-do-you-make-of-that">I think that’s a biggie. JB has so many tools, but I agree that it may be overwhelming for a newbie coming onto the scene. There’s also a kind of idea like, if you spotted a restaurant that served Italian, Japanese, Greek and Turkish food, you may think okay, they can’t possibly be doing all that correct. What do you make of that?<a class="hash-link" href="#i-think-thats-a-biggie-jb-has-so-many-tools-but-i-agree-that-it-may-be-overwhelming-for-a-newbie-coming-onto-the-scene-theres-also-a-kind-of-idea-like-if-you-spotted-a-restaurant-that-served-italian-japanese-greek-and-turkish-food-you-may-think-okay-they-cant-possibly-be-doing-all-that-correct-what-do-you-make-of-that" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Yeah, for sure. What’s great is that JB has really shown that it is aligned with memetic fundraisers in the past. I don’t know if you’d call it product market fit (PMF) yet, but it has the orientation toward PMF with these memetic raises, some of them more enduring than others. Hopefully it can be useful for enduring long term treasury management functions.</p><p>One thing I think about— there’s lot of NFT projects that set aside a portion of sales/royalties to  a treasury (which is sitting in a multisig somewhere). Maybe the collection lost momentum, who knows, but that funding is still hanging around somewhere. I have an assumption that there are dozens or more multisigs that belong to a DAO that have 50-250 ETH sitting in it without a lot of activity. If those things had been run on something like JB, maybe there could have been tools JB would have offered to make sure funds like that were put to use.</p><p>I definitely do agree regarding the interface/tooling offerings— it’ll be interesting to see what happens since JB is one interface right now, and that has value. But ultimately I think we’ll see more interface experimentation. In the past when the Mandarin speakers came in, I was supportive of the idea to create some kind of interface that’s more conducive to that new community group. As JB grows I think we may see things like that.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-do-you-think-pmf-looks-like-for-jb">What do you think PMF looks like for JB?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-do-you-think-pmf-looks-like-for-jb" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>I’m most interested in enduring projects that use the protocl as their treasury. I think—and maybe my thinking has evolved on it— but last year as I got to understand JB in greater detail, I felt like there’s two functions for DAOs. One is a place to hold your assets— that’s JB— whether assets are ETH or NFTs or whatever— and the other a place where governance happens. I don’t know that we’ve figured out the most effective way to run governance, but JB governance works extremely well in my opinion. The way JB uses the treasury to handle contributor salary, other expenses, or the network effect when projects pay each other— for instance how JB relates to Wagmi, Canu, Peel, Lexicon Devils— collaborative DAOs end up holding a piece of each other and having a stake in each other’s future. That has potential to have a serious network effect.</p><p>Look at SharkDAO, they have a huge amount of JBX, in their case they don’t really vote on stuff and their JBX isn’t super valuable, but it would be nice to start to see that happen with partner DAOs.</p><p>I think the thing we’re missing is the NFT thing— that’s the key in my opinion to returning revenue over time. Canu, Wagmi, etc., are paid through JB, so they can show how great the network is because they have locked in revenue from the revenue fees JB takes from all projects on the protocol. I think if we could create non-JB originating revenues, that would be fascinating.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="not-to-mention-the-landscape-may-be-changing-a-bit-here-lets-talk-about-soulbound-tokens-sbts-which-may-be-on-the-horizon-the-idea-here-is-tokens-that-are-non-transferable-some-say-good-idea-others-say-its-just-a-way-to-make-resumes-in-web3-what-do-you-make-of-that">Not to mention the landscape may be changing a bit here. Let’s talk about “Soulbound” tokens (SBTs), which may be on the horizon. The idea here is tokens that are non-transferable. Some say good idea, others say it’s just a way to make resumes in web3. What do you make of that?<a class="hash-link" href="#not-to-mention-the-landscape-may-be-changing-a-bit-here-lets-talk-about-soulbound-tokens-sbts-which-may-be-on-the-horizon-the-idea-here-is-tokens-that-are-non-transferable-some-say-good-idea-others-say-its-just-a-way-to-make-resumes-in-web3-what-do-you-make-of-that" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>The idea of non-transferable tokens… it’s interesting. I think no matter what in web3, if you’re an amazing code you will probably always get work. But that being said treating SBT’s like a resume can definitely happen too. I have to say I haven’t read the paper yet, so I’m just going off of what I heard floating around the web3 space.</p><p>Long term, there’s a decent argument against it, which is that in ten years I don’t think any of us will be using the same wallet. But overall, I think it’s trying to answer the problem of these membership DAOs. If you base your membership on holding a market-tradable token, the appreciation of the token will ultimately result in the dilution of the quality of the members of your community as people sell.</p><p>Also JokeDAO comes to mind, where if you participate in their competition by submitting a joke, you get voting tokens for the subsequent competition.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="one-time-use-tokens-in-other-words">One-time use tokens in other words.<a class="hash-link" href="#one-time-use-tokens-in-other-words" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Yes exactly. I think that’s even more interesting to be honest. The ecosystem rewards people for trying new things and experimenting.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-about-sbts-as-a-scarlet-letter-in-other-words-as-a-means-to-damage-someone">What about SBT’s as a scarlet letter, in other words as a means to damage someone?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-about-sbts-as-a-scarlet-letter-in-other-words-as-a-means-to-damage-someone" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>For sure that could happen, I think it will depend on the person minting and their reputation. One of the things about NFTs I wondered was people doing antisocial NFTs, like people tokenizing their virginity, or tokenizing school shooters.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="excellent-points-whos-your-favorite-contributor-and-why-is-it-tankbottoms">Excellent points.

Tankbottoms is great. There are so many great contributors honestly. If I had to point to anyone in particular, the person I admire most or seek to learn the most from is jango. There are many talented contributors, but jango has the talent I most wish I had— which is real clarity. It doesn’t mean jango knows everything and everyone follows him. It means he has real clarity around orientation to questions. You could call it vision, but that maybe that’s reductive. It’s more like in discussions he’s able to refocus very fluently. And of course being able to travel up and down the stack is incredible. Tankbottoms also is an unbelievable contributor in terms of accumulated experience and raw skill, which is so great. I mean, he’s just turning out stuff that other teams talk about for a year, and tank turns it out like that.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-something-people-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you">What is something people would be surprised to learn about you?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-something-people-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Lately I’ve been doing kickboxing every week with my girlfriend and roommate. I’m also a total youtube fanatic and I rarely watch under 2x speed. My biggest interest for the past little while is in Magic the Gathering! A friend gave me the idea that we’re like the CPUs when we play MtG, and the game is the rules of machine, and… it’s like if javascript was run by a company and the only thing you could exercise and execute were functions that are sold 10 times a year. I’m really fascinated by it. I also love going on really long walks, like for hours and hours.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-does-the-future-have-in-store-for-nicholas">What does the future have in store for nicholas?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-does-the-future-have-in-store-for-nicholas" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>I’m working on an NFT collection, actually, that I’m really pumped about.

Bug updates by @jango<a class="hash-link" href="#1-bug-updates-by-jango" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>@Jango: The same bug update that I presented about last week that we caught about a week ago. As of a few mins ago about 95% got resolved to just the final step of re-issuing the tokens for those who contributed to projects before we re-deployed things. </p><p>Everything is being tracked in the <a href="https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/blob/main/security/postmortem/5.24.2022.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">postmortem</a> that is the V2 contract repository. I’m very excited to tie that off and make progress on all other stuff coming up. Also project creation is back up.</p><p>filipv: I am gonna ask about litDAO specifically. Are they holding back token narration for all projects right now?</p><p>jango: We’re gonna run a script to help go through play by play of what we’re doing. We re-deployed basically all the contracts except for Juicebox projects(so they can keep their NFT i.e. the ownership to the projects) and a few auxiliary contracts that don’t have dependency. We re-deployed the token contract, funding cycle store, the terminals, etc. Once projects re-launch their funding cycles, everyone starts from Funding cycle #1 again. The front end made it very easy to use the same configurations as their previous funding cycle in the old contract had. Once they make that, they also have 0 token supply in the new token contract. But several projects have already received funds and started distributing tokens.</p><p>The original plan was to have project owners initiate a few transactions to airdrop tokens to their token holders, which is super doable but requires 3-4 transactions and it’s a bit complicated. In general, the scope of the problem is very small, given where we are in the protocol deployed a few weeks ago. So instead, I’m gonna send a few transactions that we scripted after this Town Hall that’s gonna deposit and basically re-created the activities for each project. Let’s say moonmars have received 10 payments each with its memo and it beneficiary of token. We’ll just send those out again. And from the deployer wallet as we run the script, we will pay in some ETH and set the original beneficiary of tokens as a beneficiary. So once all the activities are up again, then the token balance of each project should reflect their old token balance. I’ll open a proposal to refund the deployer.</p><p>@filipv: So are we repaying all the balance that all the V2 projects have received so far?</p><p>@jango: I think the total will be 11ETH if all projects are to relaunch funding cycles, which is a prerequisite, and then we’ll drop the funds in both as a bonus for everybody for the hiccup, and also thanks for the patience throughout this process. I think it’s better to solve this problem with money, than to cause poor UX, and I think it’s worthy given its scale. But this also taught us a lot about how to solve this problem given a larger scope. That loss is in lieu of communication headaches that cause us to make sure that the projects are clicking the right button and not getting themselves into other nuts. </p><p>@filipv: Are we doing reimbursement for gas fees associated with redeployment and project updates?</p><p>@jango: Yes. The big one is projects that have deployed ERC-20, which is the most expensive transaction. We have a list of projects that have that before, and we’ll drop in 0.2ETH in their treasury, which is part of the number I quoted before. After this call, I’ll run it and we’ll be super in the clear and make moves towards the stuff we were working on before.</p><p>@filipv: Last question, what’s going on with the ETH in the V2 projects right now on the old version of the contract? Can project creators just distribute it if they’d like to, or figure out what they’re gonna do with it?</p><p>@jango: For the most part those have been distributed. I went through to empty those out as the UI no longer interacts with them. You can always go to etherscan.io to pull them out. I think litDAO has a 100% overflow, so any funds in there can be redeemed by token holders. So if you did contribute to the DAO before, it’s now a fine time to go and redeem, or they can submit a reconfiguration on the old funding cycle to raise and pull funds out. It’s the bonus we’re going to give them if they want to go to the trouble to get those, which is for them to choose.</p><p>Once we found this bug, it was tempting for us to just keep our heads down, mitigate it and try to fix it. But communicating with projects and making sure everyone understands what’s going on is important, so it’s certainly cool to do stuff and prod. </p><p>It’s still pretty incredible that we found this bizarrely niche bug this early on. I’m pretty confident here going forward. It’s kind of weird to start and then already have a bug. I definitely understand if there’s a sense of hesitancy. I’ll have to work through that, give it time and put weight on it incrementally and regain trust in ourselves. I feel pretty good about it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-morgensterns-ice-cream-event-by-zom_bae-and-kenbot">2. Morgenstern’s Ice Cream event by @Zom_Bae and @Kenbot:<a class="hash-link" href="#2-morgensterns-ice-cream-event-by-zom_bae-and-kenbot" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>@Zom_Bae: If you haven’t been keeping up, Morgenstern’s Finest Ice Cream is hosting a JuiceboxDAO event for three days over NFT NYC. We, as a DAO, got to vote on 6 custom unique ice cream flavors, which is pretty cool. Check out <a href="https://juicebox.notion.site/ICE-CREAM-FLAVOR-SUBMISSIONS-c84ed139d9a64bf68099a210942b98db" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a>, and submit your crazy wacky creations by June 2. On that day we’ll get a list compiled and vote on Discord for the top 6, which are going to be tweaked and refined by Nicholas Morgenstern himself and then be served at our event over the 3 days.</p><p>Kenbot and I over the last week have been really digging into this and finding a way to make it more than just an ice cream social. And I think we’ve got a really unique opportunity here to bring some really cool projects into Juicebox and get them building in the protocol, and also really get the word out for Juicebox. </p><p>We’ve been talking for a long time that Juicebox hasn’t really done a whole lot of marketing other than our twitter, word of mouth, and the big one-off projects like ConstitutionDAO and AssangeDAO. We are still in early phases for that, but the ice cream social the way it’s building up is gonna be an event inside an event of NFT NYC. We’re going to have a schedule of things going on each day. We’d love to do some twitter space, AMA and podcast if we can.</p><p>Lexicon Devils are making a replica of this event in <a href="https://www.cryptovoxels.com/spaces/344a9048-9c09-462e-9d76-f292185922a9/play" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cryptovoxels.com</a> , which is pretty cool.</p><p>So any of you is gonna be in NY for this event and is willing and able and down to be a part of that, I really want you to be.</p><p>@kenbot: What we’re thinking about is we can have their windows as soon as we can get going. So we can have a week running up before the event to promote right in the space what we are gonna be doing there. The thought is who do we want to reach out to, who’s walking by that place, who’s in downtown NY at that time, and we want to capture and have them come back.</p><p>So that’s going to be ideas that we can have a theme of bringing creatives together, to open their Juicebox projects and fund their dream projects. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-stories-about-blockspilt-and-nft-berlin-by-zeugh">3. Stories about BlockSpilt and NFT Berlin by @Zeugh:<a class="hash-link" href="#3-stories-about-blockspilt-and-nft-berlin-by-zeugh" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>@Zeugh: Me and JohnnyD have been going around for the last week. We’ve started the idea of testing the gorilla marketing tactics, by going to some blockchain, Ethereum or NFT conferences. This time we went to BlockSplits in Croatia and NFT Berlin so far. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-blocksplits">1) BlockSplits<a class="hash-link" href="#1-blocksplits" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>We got to BlockSplit on Tuesday last week. First thing we swa was a panel of legal side of things about new regulations in the EU and it felt like this was the wrong place to be. We came to this event for 2 main goals. The first one was to do some user research, try to listen to people that are creating projects, and try to understand how they currently manage their treasury. And the other idea was to onboard some of them. The event ended up evolving into something we understand as Web2.5. BlockSplit Croatia was more of using  blockchain technologies on traditional startups. </p><p>Interesting insights from BlockSplit were, there were some L2 builders from Boba network and they were interested in how we can bring Juicebox to their L2. I found it unusual that there will actually be people building L2 looking for people to go into their chains. I talked to them and onboarded them to our server. They want to come on and discuss how they could help a process like this to happen. </p><p>Also from BlockSplit, there was a very interesting group called Resolute that focuses on web3 marketing. They got very interested in how we’re doing things and how they can help with that. I am bringing them to our server this week for them to take a look at our strategy discussion and the marketing part.</p><p>Everyone got interested in how we are doing things actually, no one has ever seen a DAO actually run and work with a profitable and functional business model. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-nft-berlin">2) NFT Berlin<a class="hash-link" href="#2-nft-berlin" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>From BlockSplit we flew to Berlin, and NFT Berlin was the opposite of BlockSplit, where most people were not directly involved with a project, they were mostly collectors and fans of the whole NFT fever.</p><p>In there we got in depth looks at what NFT creation could use Juicebox for. JohnnyD was amazing in focusing in how we can create better models using Juicebox, some templates or preset configurations that could be useful for NFT creators, to give their buyers or investors more confidence in investing, to make sure that if a rug pull happens everyone has time to pull back. Those features made everyone’s eyes shine.</p><p>We got in touch with NFT Club Berlin. They are a big local group of NFT investors and collectors. We have follow-up calls this week to show them how to use the templates so that they can start referencing that in their community.</p><p>The experience as a whole was great beyond the event itself. We stayed for the hackathon, helped people on the hackathon deploy or understand something about our products. We got invited for the ETH Barcelona to be part of the hackathon there to help them get DAO hackathon. They are interested in having us as the main DAO on that, because we were one of those that does have an actual toolkit and a workshop and content to provide for a hackathon. </p><p>And we faced the problem of gas fee in NFT Berlin again and again, for the fact that we only run on Ethereum was definitely a barrier for some project creators that we talked to.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-discussion">3) Discussion<a class="hash-link" href="#3-discussion" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>@filip: Do you feel like what you learned from those events changed your strategy? Do you still feel the same way about the strategy?</p><p>@Zeugh: I don’t know. I really don’t know, because the strategy has been going back and forth from different talks, so I’m not sure if I have a clear feeling before saying it has changed.</p><p>I definitely feel more confident on going projects to projects in an event, just talking about Juicebox, asking what people are doing and how they are doing. I learned better the right questions to ask to understand if we can provide value to them or not, and to learn why we can why we can’t.</p><p>I think the most beneficial part was the user research part beyond the few projects we onboarded. I think it was the biggest gain.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-quizz-time">4.

Burtula has posted a new animation of a Banny (Peach Banny to be precise) getting kidnapped in her sleep. Mieos likes it, but suggests smoothing it out, so the kidnapping can seem more natural. Tankbottoms is asking about asset folders to be filled out, and Sage is coming off being stranded in Idaho with a transmission-less car and working feverishly through her phone.</p><p>It’s only 8:30am. The day is just beginning. Felix has spent the better part of two days sourcing custom-made condoms— tri-fold condoms, to be exact, so each Banny can have their own condom packaging, with a pop-out tri-fold to really bring the point home. A banny wrapped in the coital experience, Felixander would tell you, is the most salient testament to the human condition.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1200pm">12:00pm<a class="hash-link" href="#1200pm" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Burtula is taking Mieos’ words of advice to heart. After all, if a banny is going to get kidnapped, that should look natural. What will future customers think if such a traumatic experience seems rushed or premature? Premature— Felix is thinking of a joke, but he’s abstaining. She works tirelessly to craft the Peach banny with more finesse, and in the wait one wonders about banny backgrounds— are we even saving all of them?</p><p>5 creative people stuffed into a studio, and not a shred of organizational prowess between them. Do we have a Peach Banny background? Of course we do. But where is it? Oh yeah, it’s in one of the thirteen discord channels at Wagmi, and it was posted a month ago. It may as well be in the ether, but that doesn’t stop us all from scrolling up wildly to find it.</p><p>Meanwhile tankbottoms is white knuckling it on at least hour 36 of a god-knows-how-long working sprint. His work pace has Cocaine saying bro, slow down, you’re harshing my vibe here. We try to get in touch with him, but on hour 36 the quality of response you can expect is a bit frayed to put it mildly. Tankbottoms operates on a bonding curve of consciousness— if you get your request in early, he will deliver a fucking spectacular answer. But if you’re in that last 5 hour span, you’re gonna get caught holding the bag.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="500pm">5:00pm<a class="hash-link" href="#500pm" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Meanwhile we’re trying to get a presentation on some UI from Sage. The Figma files are fire, and between randomly being jailed and what one can only assume is the wisdom derived from several ayahuasca trips, Sage delivers. She elegantly goes though all the work she’s put into the latest UI iteration, and everyone is blown away and gives her praises, but she has to cut it short because a coyote chewing on some old cigarettes by a roadside is giving her the stink eye, and it may get nasty.</p><p>They ask Felix what he thinks about the UI, but all he can think about is how a single tri-fold condom costs $1.64, but if we get ten thousand that price goes down to $0.46 per unit. He wants to make a joke about units, but he abstains. He’s crafting an email asking how many banana-pictures they can print on a single tri-fold, and he’s doing the math and thinking that we can make condoms cool, one self-referential banana at a time. He’s wondering if we can turn this all into a romance novel, where the Bannies fuck each other in only the most pleasant of language.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="800pm">8:00pm<a class="hash-link" href="#800pm" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>We look to Mieos for guidance, but he’s on a treasure hunt deep in cryptovoxels, and he’s trying to embed 12 seed phrases the best he can and he’s having a blast doing it. Meanwhile Burtula is waiting for an answer about her animation, and people may be ready to start considering it, but just at that moment tank is wondering why these blog posts are even generated by lowly meatsacks like Felix— can’t all this shit be generated on chain?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1200am">12:00am<a class="hash-link" href="#1200am" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>For this hour, nothing really happens at all, and nobody is working on anything.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="100am">1:00am<a class="hash-link" href="#100am" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>The day is winding down. Condoms have been designed for an order that’s never likely to happen. An animation is still waiting to be fine-tuned. Sage is coming off some hard psychedelics, or at least she should be for the amount of work she does. Tank is crashing for the next 47 hours. Mieos sits back in a recliner with a cat that he caresses knowingly, cackling into the moonlight as he reflects on another solid day.</p><p>Nothing finalized, nothing completed. Incremental progress happened, but the struggle continues the next day. But a hell of a lot of fun was had.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>标签：</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zh/blog/tags/dao">dao</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zh/blog/tags/shitpost">shitpost</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zh/blog/tags/juicebox">juicebox</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/zh/blog/juicebox-in-the-world-of-aeolian">Juicebox in the Words of aeolian</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-05-24T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">2022年5月24日</time> · <!-- -->9 分钟阅读</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/realfelixander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1509677708854239233/Bsru0Xks_400x400.jpg" alt="Felixander"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/realfelixander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Felixander</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Community Member</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>“Juicebox in the words of” is a series that highlights JB community members in interview form.

Generally when I want to dive into something, I really wanna get into the nuts/bolts and learn it from the ground up. I finally found myself with the time to do that, and me and a couple friends found this NFT project we liked, and even though we couldn’t really afford to buy the NFT separately, if we pull our funds together… and it was like a lightbulb moment. We thought hey, what about this whole DAO thing happening— what if we make a DAO that buys some NFTs. So I found JB and started poking around, and it was coincidentally the same time that ConstitutionDAO was happening. I was drawn in by the amazing branding of Banny (a banana smoking a joint was just amazing) and the next day I wake up, log into discord, and I see the treasury has grown to like 20 million overnight. Once I saw that and started really thinking about the potential of this thing I immediately dropped everything I was doing and started trying to contribute where I could, especially on the dev side and front-end side. Peri welcomed us with open arms and the rest is history as they say.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="awesome-so-much-talk-lately-about-v2-how-would-you-put-v2-in-perspective-for-someone-not-technically-aware-of-all-the-changes">Awesome.

When we talk about V2 we’re talking about the protocol itself. Jango, Drgorilla and a bunch of others have identified some tings about V1 which were restrictive, like that projects can only raise money in ETH and not in other currencies, that there’s less flexibility around how they can configure projects to meet their needs, and so on. The protocol guys said let’s start developing V2 and improve it from the ground up, and so the front-end’s job in that is basically to support those new additions. There’s exciting potential use cases, like funding your project through your own NFT launch, or like a project that comes along that says we want to award contributors with an NFT that they can sell on secondary market, and the proceeds of those NFTs will go straight into a JB treasury. Another biggie is supporting multi-currencies— projects accepting stablecoins instead of just ETH. Truthfully we don’t even know all the possibilities that it is hopefully going to open up, which is what makes it all the more exciting.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="im-reminded-of-the-story-of-that-city-planner-in-england-way-back-when-who-had-the-roads-built-twice-as-wide-as-necessary-people-thought-he-was-crazy-but-he-saw-a-future-with-population-explosion-do-you-view-v2-as-built-for-the-realities-of-tomorrow">I’m reminded of the story of that city planner in England way back when, who had the roads built twice as wide as necessary.

Do you view V2 as built for the realities of tomorrow?<a class="hash-link" href="#im-reminded-of-the-story-of-that-city-planner-in-england-way-back-when-who-had-the-roads-built-twice-as-wide-as-necessary-people-thought-he-was-crazy-but-he-saw-a-future-with-population-explosion-do-you-view-v2-as-built-for-the-realities-of-tomorrow" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Haha, I super admire anyone that can have that kind of forethought and conviction in their idea of the future. When you’re building a protocol as the ecosystem saw with V1, it enables a set of use cases which, in the case of V1, proved to be successful with big fundraisers that make big volume in a short amount of time. Look at the internet– such a non-restrictive, base-level protocol, and look at it now. The creators of the internet would have had no idea that it would become what it is now. Not unlike JB with this website of this smoking banana that enables millions of dollars of fundraising.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="theres-been-this-wonderful-discussion-about-compensation-lately-where-does-a-dao-strike-a-balance-between-compensating-members-and-staying-lean-for-a-down-the-line-bigger-payout">There’s been this wonderful discussion about compensation lately.

Like someone said in that thread on compensation— I don’t remember who— but comparing people based on a number is just not healthy, right? That’s what people don’t like about traditional corporate life, and that’s why people find themselves in web3 and crypto. They want to escape that world and operate in a space that lets them do what interests them the most. In terms of how to think about it from a first-principles perspective, which I’m trying to do, let’s start with startups. I don’t think the startup model is perfect by any means– it probably disproportionately rewards the founders more than early builders. So that’s not exactly a blueprint for us either.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="its-just-so-complicated-right-so-many-smart-people-and-no-one-has-been-able-to-find-that-holy-grail-answer">It’s just so complicated right?

And drawing from the corporate world and those structures probably is not the right way to go about it either. I’m not a crypto/web3 maximalist in that sense though, I do think people can learn things from those who have come before us, but we’re here to make our own rules and to do what makes sense for us and what leads to the most amazing ecosystem that we can possibly build. That’s what we’re all here to do. The fact that that thread exists and other threads like it exist is a real testament to this community because we’re driven and passionate about figuring this stuff out. That, in my opinion, is the sign of a really healthy community.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="no-egos-can-be-around-in-this-right-how-come-egos-dont-seem-to-clash-more-in-these-situations">No egos can be around in this right– how come egos don’t seem to clash more in these situations?<a class="hash-link" href="#no-egos-can-be-around-in-this-right-how-come-egos-dont-seem-to-clash-more-in-these-situations" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>There’s something about JB, or the way that the community presents itself, whether on socials or within the discord, that it leads to a certain type of person sticking around. People are sufficiently motivated at JB. When teams break apart and things don’t happen it’s because people gave up on figuring out how to make it work. Everyone here recognizes the opportunity we have in front of us, to build this amazing thing and a solid foundation for us to all go forward. It’s a recognition that if we can really sit down and work all this stuff out we’re really gonna be able to build amazing things.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="do-you-think-the-jb-runway-threatened-by-the-compensation-models-we-have-now-jb-never-had-any-vc-coming-in-so-how-do-you-reconcile-that">Do you think the JB runway threatened by the compensation models we have now?

We really do have to think about this stuff. We have to sit down and think about it from a first-principles perspective, rather than approaching it in the traditional way of doing these things.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-about-the-workflow-over-time-problem-ie-what-happens-when-your-job-drops-off-in-work-to-do-because-you-executed-the-task-but-youre-still-getting-this-big-recurring-payout">What about the workflow over time problem– ie, what happens when your job drops off in work to do because you executed the task, but you’re still getting this big recurring payout?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-about-the-workflow-over-time-problem-ie-what-happens-when-your-job-drops-off-in-work-to-do-because-you-executed-the-task-but-youre-still-getting-this-big-recurring-payout" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>That’s the biggie, you’ve hit the nail on the head. One model we’ve stewarded is that the front-end team has broken out into its own treasury in Peel, and that allows us to be more intentional with how we fund projects. It really allows two things: we can onboard quickly those who we think are really good, and we can also understand their skill set right away. We know what we’re looking for and the broader DAO doesn’t have to go in and make a decision on every single recurring payout proposal that comes through that affects the front-end. That’s one model that’s been working for us, but these things are all emerging, and that what makes me super excited to be here in JB and in web3.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="got-it-okay-lets-get-down-to-brass-tacks-whos-your-favorite-jb-member-and-why-is-it-jango">Got it.

I’m just gonna quote it here:</p><p><em>“i like hangin with folks that can be fluid between bullshitting and manifesting, fluid between appreciating beauty and ugly, fluid between conversation and silence, fluid between humor and practicality, fluid between been in awe of everything and focusing on the next idea in front of us. I&#x27;m attracted as fuck to people with big imaginations who make moves towards them.”</em></p><p>That was like such an amazing statement because it’s really hard to find people who are <em>your</em> people. I feel like my people are this: people who strike that balance between brilliance and focus, but also are able to laugh at the ridiculousness of life, and so I guess when I read that I was like damn, I will definitely be vibing here for many years.</p><p>But my homies at Peel definitely need a huge shoutout.

I guess one thing is that I started programming very late, and I actually always wanted to be a film composer— writing music for movies. That’s what I was doing before becoming a software engineer. Through high school I was pretty much all about music; I played piano and a bunch of other instruments and I got really into writing music for film, and I thought I would take that road. Eventually I kind of just realized it wasn’t coming from a place of pure passion and excitement. I realized as a musician you have to write music you don’t care to write oftentimes, and take jobs that don’t interest you at all. So I looked for another avenue and it was kind of just random how it happened: I went to university for some unrelated degree and fell in love with programming and comp sci along the way.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>标签：</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zh/blog/tags/dao">dao</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zh/blog/tags/interview">interview</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zh/blog/tags/juicebox">juicebox</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/zh/blog/how-juicebox-for-nfts">HOW Juicebox for NFT Projects?</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-05-24T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">2022年5月24日</time> · <!-- -->5 分钟阅读</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/JohnnyD_eth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1509621120181444608/lycnkGHp_400x400.jpg" alt="johnnyD"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/JohnnyD_eth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">johnnyD</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Peel Contributor</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>In case you don’t know, Juicebox is the best way to fund and operate any Web3 business, especially NFT projects.

Funding<a class="hash-link" href="#1-funding" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="funding-cycles">Funding cycles<a class="hash-link" href="#funding-cycles" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>We highly recommend using a funding cycle. This is the time period over which distributions will be made and other Juicebox settings such as the discount rate will be applied. Common funding cycle lengths are 1 week, 2 weeks or 1 month.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="distributions">Distributions<a class="hash-link" href="#distributions" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>You can specify the amount you’d like to distribute to each member of your team per funding cycle from the treasury. If you don’t raise the total amount of funds you’ve planned for your whole team, then each team member will be paid the percentage you’ve specified for them from any funds you have raised. For instance, if you planned for Mike and Bob to get 1 ETH each per week, but you only raised 1 ETH total in a certain week, then they will just get 0.5 ETH each. </p><p>If you’re opting not to go for the shared treasury approach, you can route all funds from the treasury straight to the owner, or a percentage cut to any other wallet address.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="token">Token<a class="hash-link" href="#token" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reserved-rate">Reserved rate<a class="hash-link" href="#reserved-rate" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>As mentioned earlier, whenever new tokens are minted as a result of someone buying an NFT or contributing for tokens straight up, this percentage of those new tokens will be reserved and the rest will go to the buyer. By default, these tokens are reserved for the project owner, but you can also allocate portions to other wallet addresses. A reserved rate of 50% will ensure the project owners maintain a majority share of the treasury and may be a good option for your project. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="discount-rate">Discount rate<a class="hash-link" href="#discount-rate" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>The discount rate incentivises people to get in early on your project. It controls how the issue rate of your community ERC20 token changes over time. A higher discount rate means people who buy your NFT in the early days will receive more tokens / ETH than those who come in later. An exact figure is hard to give, but with a funding cycle length of 2 weeks, a discount rate of 10% may be a good place to start.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="redemption-rate">Redemption rate<a class="hash-link" href="#redemption-rate" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>This redemption rate encourages token holders to hodl and stick with your project token for the long term. On a lower redemption rate, redeeming a token increases the value of each remaining token, creating an incentive to hold tokens longer than other holders. Similar to the discount rate, you’ll have to gauge how aggressively you want to pull this level, but a redemption rate between 50 and 75% is probably a good place to start. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-rules">3. Rules<a class="hash-link" href="#3-rules" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="pause-payments">Pause payments<a class="hash-link" href="#pause-payments" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>You probably don’t want to check this. Check it only if you want to hold off payments for a certain period after you create your project.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="allow-token-minting">Allow token minting<a class="hash-link" href="#allow-token-minting" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>You probably don’t want to check this either, it allows project owners to mint any amount of tokens to anyone on demand. Whenever you have this enabled, your project will have a warning flag on its Juicebox page warning contributors of the possibility of their tokens being diluted. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reconfiguration">Reconfiguration<a class="hash-link" href="#reconfiguration" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>This is important. It restricts how long before the next funding cycle reconfigurations must be submitted before they are able to take effect. For example, with a 3-day delay (a good starting point), a reconfiguration to an upcoming funding cycle must be submitted at least 3 days before it starts. It’s a great way to ensure your community against any malicious owner behavior. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-create-a-payable-address">2. Create a payable address<a class="hash-link" href="#2-create-a-payable-address" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>This will create an Ethereum address that can be used to pay your project, rather than having to go through the Juicebox interface. It will be necessary in the model of the Juicebox NFT project we’re going for, since you will use this address as the destination for your royalty fees. You will be prompted to do this when you create your project, but can do it later at any time in the ‘Tools’ section of your project page pictured below. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/zh/assets/images/image2-5d26b330ea8f22c7d9c6ab98e456de54.png" width="1999" height="616" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-do-your-thang-on-opensea-or-wherever-send-royalty-fees-to-the-payable-address-let-the-magic-happen">3.

A bug saga by @jango<a class="hash-link" href="#1-a-bug-saga-by-jango" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>Jango: This morning STVG posted at the loose_thoughts channel: What if we could pause a project mid-Funding cycle? He was trying to play with the Marine County Swim Association project(this is a sweet event pulled off by STVG) to pause it since the event was finished. And through a series of botched configurations, the project ended up in a really weird state. The project’s current funding cycle is set to start on May 28th which makes no sense as the current funding cycle should always be active. </p><p>So at this point, something is for sure up or at least not served correctly or the front end isn’t interpreting correctly. That’s quick to check. The etherscan.io confirmed that the current funding cycle starts at a later day. I went to check the unit tests and there were a bunch of cases that I felt this was trying to cover and still passing. So I tried to create the situation exactly and was still struggling to do so. What ended up being the exact step to follow to recreate the bug which I eventually found was: if you create a funding cycle or configure a funding cycle with a duration and then let it roll over to the next funding cycle without reconfiguring, now you’re in the 2nd funding cycle, now you’re in the 2nd funding cycle of the 1st configuration. Then you configure the subsequent one, and before the current cycle is over, you reconfigure the subsequent one again to override the previous configuration. If you’re in this exact state, the 2nd reconfiguration, instead of being based on the 1st FC which you kinda rolling over onto, will be based on the funding cycle you are going to override. </p><p>That puts us in a weird state. The edge case was not covered in the tests. So I quickly wrote a test and confirmed it, before I found the one line to add to the contract to fix the problem to make the test pass, which I’ll post here:
<img loading="lazy" src="/zh/assets/images/code-e4c28620c5d5d721371c3e85652c998b.png" width="958" height="274" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>So once we identified the problem, sorry I&#x27;m kind of doing a realtime postmortem here and I’ll write this up later, then we can start to think about the solutions and consequences. Luckily V2 was deployed only recently and there are only 27 projects at the time. And most projects don’t have large volumes in their treasury either, the bug doesn’t affect the treasuries so funds are all safe, too. </p><p>All we are gonna do is letting these projects know that this condition exists, and from our point of view, we should probably make the adjustment in the funding cycle store which is a dependency like all other contracts or the core contracts in the ecosystem which is gonna nudge us towards republishing and redeploying the V2 contacts. </p><p>It’s not 100% sure that we need to redeploy the project contract, which will be nice with all the NFT stays. Even if we do, we can get in touch with all these projects, make sure they can redeploy on the new version, make sure funds get moved over and make sure token holders get airdropped the new supply of the token.</p><p>This comes in the name of diverse conversion stuff we have been talking about. We know we are working with fragile and delicate infrastructure. I am happy to catch this very early on in the process, as this V2 stuff just gets trickier over time. And then obviously if you  were to know about it and think about it maliciously, it’s an exploit if you want to use it in that way.</p><p>A big shout out to folks involved to kinda come through and help once we wrapped our heads around the issue. Peri came in right away and adjusted some of the front end to make sure new projects can not be created on juicebox.money. And shout out to STVG for clicking a button which you described as chaotic and you weren’t really sure if you miss-clicked a few things, or you did a couple of things twice because you forgot to do it. That ended up showing us the way.</p><p>It’s pretty mind-blowing that that was a test case we have yet to cover. And it’s hard to believe there are any more of these lingering. The scope of these contracts is pretty tight. I think V2 actually removed bits and pieces of funding cycles, so the V2 funding cycle store is way leaner than the V1 one. I haven’t checked if the contracts of V1 have the same vulnerability in it, but I actually don’t think they do because that piece of logic got reassessed. </p><p>@filipv: Huge shout out to everybody esp. STVG. This is so good that this was found now instead of 3 months from now.</p><p>@0xSTVG: I’ll ask my original question. Is there a way to pause? I’m in a 5-day funding cycle, I reached my goal so I wanted to just pause payment even though I am in the middle of the funding cycle. I can’t do that, I can pause it but it’s going to take effect only when the current funding cycle is over.
@jango: yeah, you can set up a pay delegate to revert the transaction if you’ve met a goal, you could write an extension that just does that if you want. But by default you can’t. Once we put it on the shelf then you’ll be able to pull it off the shelf and use it, but we have to build it out first.</p><p>It feels like it’s at a lighter moment now. Most of the morning was pretty tense on my end at least, and obviously we take these things very seriously, make sure we’re articulating this stuff correctly and documenting that correctly. I think we are still all gonna make it.</p><p>All V2 projects on the site currently have a sweet alert on them. Hopefully all the communities running on it, not just project owners we reached out, see this warning and get a heads up for what’s going on. Thank you Peri, for coming through.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/zh/assets/images/project-79494c1581f0f74e00746563a6f98954.png" width="952" height="496" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-demo-of-vebanny-by-0xba5ed">2. Demo of veBanny by @0xBA5ED:<a class="hash-link" href="#2-demo-of-vebanny-by-0xba5ed" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>I’ll give a quick refresher on what veBanny is for, as I don’t know if everyone here has heard about or seen it before. So, veBanny is a way to make sure everyone who’s voting in the governance is focused on the long term instead of the short term. It’s a way to lock your tokens, the longer duration you lock for, the more voting power you’ll get. When you do that, you’ll get veBanny NFT to represent your locked tokens. </p><p>(Screen sharing of demo starts)</p><p>In the future you don’t have to receive the ERC-20 to lock your position. And it allows the public to extend the lock.</p><p>@filipv: Can you explain very quickly what a public extension is?</p><p>@jango: By default, once you’ve created a lock, then it’ll linearly decrease when time ticks on. Let’s say you lock it for 100 days, tomorrow the lock will be 99 days. So to get the full voting power, which is a function of how many days between now and the end of the lock, you’ll want to extend the lock back to 100 days, which is a transaction that needs gas. But sometimes if you have someone to be able to go in and send that transaction to extend your lock, you can set that flag to True. </p><p>If you intend to keep a locked position, maybe you have a voting habit, or someone who can easily afford that transaction can go in and extend it for you. Or if you don’t choose that, we’ll have control over it so you can inch toward liquidity of your position at the rate that you choose. That thing was added as a result of discussion when this was being designed, that a lot of people want to keep their voting power full, but they might not want to be sending transactions regularly and this is precautionary. I don’t know at what frequency people will want to send that extension transaction on their own, but it was a quick flag to add that didn’t open up a lot of weird complexity, so we put it there.</p><p>@filipv: Is that something that can be reconfigured? Can I send a transaction to turn off the public extension on a position that I already have?</p><p>@jango: The owner can change that whenever.</p><p>@0xBA5ED: So here it is, I own it(finished locking position). So I’m going to take a pretty big risk right now because I haven’t tested this on the testnet yet. Because the minimum duration is a week to lock, so I made one veBanny a week ago. Just one, so I haven’t tested it yet. We’re going to redeem it, we’re going to unlock our tokens and redeem them for ETH from the overflow in one transaction. So let’s see.</p><p>@jango: This is another cool feature of the ve mechanism that is different from the traditional Curve ve mechanism on which this is based. Since Juicebox has redeem functionality, you can redeem your treasury tokens for the underlying treasury asset. At any point you can still redeem your locked position for the underlying treasury assets, independent of whether it&#x27;s locked or not. So you can have your tokens locked for a year, you’ll be able to get your JBX back until the year’s up. But you can burn your NFT to get your JBX to get the underlying treasury asset whenever.</p><p>@0xBA5ED: Exactly. So before I burn it, I thought that we just show the voting power actually decreasing. So this is my current voting power and every block that passes it’ll decrease. So this decreases linearly until all my NFTs expire, then I won’t have any voting power left.</p><p>@filipv: So is voting a function of block number, or a function of time and it’s just updating on block numbers?</p><p>@0xBA5ED: It’s a function of time operating on block numbers.  (redeeming…) So here it’s gone already. As you can see I burned the NFT which also burned the JBX that was locked and I got the ETH from  the overflow. I’m very happy that it works, actually I haven’t tested it yet. I know it was going to work, but still it’s a bit scary to do a demo live for the 1st time.</p><p>@Felixander: A quick question in what jango was talking about, but let’s say somebody buys an NFT and they lock 100 days, and on day 75 they want to get out and they burn everything. So you can burn the NFT and the JBX. If they went in let’s say for 100 dollars, then on day 75 if they burn everything they are not gonna get 100 dollars back right? Is that gonna depend on the value of JBX or how does that work?</p><p>@jango: They’ll be able to, all the underlying JBX are gonna be redeemed with the exact same function that the treasury normally redeems at. That doesn’t decrease linearly. The idea is probably the value of the JBX or the NFT, it’s literally the floor, so you might find more value in NFY by selling it on the market.</p><p>But the point of doing this is because they were functionalities actually fairly meaningful in the Juicebox ecosystem since we’re minting JBX open-endedly. So someone can come in right now and put in like 6m dollars worth of ETH and they basically get 50% of the JBX supply or whatever. If they weren’t trying to coordinate with the rest of us, they could take everyone’s assets then basically use that big pool of JBX to control whatever was there before. The point of redeeming is that if somebody does that in a way that’s not trying to integrate with the current system, then anyone who currently has JBX is basically getting a shit ton of money from this person who comes in, so anyone who doesn’t want to be a part of that ecosystem can redeem basically and leave with a big chunk of what was just poured in. So this is in a way to disincentivize this takeover thing. So we need to keep that mechanism in place regardless of if JBX is locked because if we lock it and don’t keep that mechanism in place, that vulnerability becomes larger. </p><p>@Felixander: One more question for the NFT profile page. Are we making a difference between different Bannies, obviously they have different histories and stats, or are we putting that in the NFT profile page or is it gonna be the same page and the info exists somewhere else on a website or something?</p><p>@tankbottoms: The thinking was just keep the metadata inside the veBanny strictly about Juicebox with the exception of the name of the character, the model and the description will be added as well as these characteristics, shadowness etc. Everything in the metadata for the token will be related to Juicebox and will speak about Juicebox. There’s a location where we could put a URL in the description in the external URL so that in the opensea UI when you go to a detail page you can jump to it. The thinking was to keep it specified to Juicebox. With that said, there’s something you can do when you load up a web page with CSS and Javascript. I am trying to do some animation with the token, so when you go to a detail page, we could put a hidden link in that people can click to jump to Bannyverse.</p><p>@Felixander: So the metadata will be the same except for the name? Or will the description model also be different?</p><p>@tankbottoms: All tokens will be unique to the lock duration. There’s 300 tokens of each range, e.g. 0-99, 100-199, up until 100m and there are five locked positions for each token. Those 300 will have metadata that says who the character is, what the duration lock is, their motto and their history. The name of the token will be the name of the character.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-vebanny-front-end-by-jmill">3. veBanny Front End by @Jmill:<a class="hash-link" href="#3-vebanny-front-end-by-jmill" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p> (demo undergoing……)</p><p>We have a deployment of this to Rinkeby now. I’m working on a contract reader actually populating those with real user data and then working on the transactions after that. The goal right now is to spend the next few days working on the contract reader transactions populating with real data and just moving the component around to where they need to go in the application and getting the front end of this at the door. </p><p>@mieos: I think this looks pretty great in this little side panel. I was skeptical about it, if we’re thinking how projects could launch a toggle over to set a locked voting token option and this sort of pops up in the UI of their project. Maybe it’s a lot of info and there’ll need to be a lot of education that goes with their community, but it’s great that it can all happen right here. For what it’s worth, I think it looks pretty good. Maybe it’s because I understand it, but it looks nice to see it in action.</p><p>@Jmill: I do agree with that because the flow for almost everything project management related is that it never takes you to a new screen entirely. Any other configuration you’re doing is out of the drawer or model, so you know that we can keep that paradigm for this also. I think it’s good that the actual controls of it are quite simple. If the user has 10 positions, there’s a good way to show that here without making them scroll forever.</p><p>@jango: We’re also getting rid of the delegates onchain in this contract, which might allow us to really get rid of it from the UI as well and we’re managing the delegates via other means like Snapshot and potentially to other stuff.</p><p>@mieos: I guess I missed that bit. I think that’s great, certainly simplifies the experience of a person who doesn&#x27;t need to learn what it means to delegate or take part in that same moment.</p><p>@jango: At this point, I think there’s still some research work for filipv on the best means. The Snapshot delegation strategy seems compelling, and there’s other schemas we’re thinking about. I think the goal of all this stuff long term is to get rid of the multisig. To get rid of the multisig we have to do some kind of on chain voting, and on chain voting can be expensive, so we have this delegation. I think there’s some creative ways we’ve been bubbling up in several veBanny related threads that seem really promising. The delegate stuff was a blocker for this to the voting weight stuff. I’m pretty confident that we can get rid of it from the design scope for the front end for the time being, we’ll work it back in later.</p><p>@Jmill: Just from a user’s standpoint, it’s a really touchy issue of how you open up this delegate picker and how do you decide what to show, which delegate option to show to the user. There wasn’t a really great answer there as far as implementing that in the rest of the UI. I’m just working from the mocks but it’s pretty easy to remove the delegate stuff.</p><p>@filipv: ENS sorted alphabetically and free delegate. One thing I should add about Snapshot delegation. There’re hybrid solutions you can do using safe snap to have on chain execution, but you still need off chain queuing, so I’m not confident in Snapshot delegation as a strategy long term on chain governance. It’s good for hybridized stuff and getting close to there, but ultimately there does need to be some form of delegation if we want to be fully on chain. But I imagine there’s other layers we can think about. </p><p>@jango: Yeah, the disposable token strategy (see <a href="https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/961007548553637970/974046109615931432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>) is very compelling to me. For now this project has a lot of merit and we still can lean on the same points of vulnerabilities that currently we are at. We’re having a multisig, having an on chain voting which seem fine tradeoffs for the time being as we work towards to study our future.</p><p>If we can eventually have these as soon as people start having these Banny characters representing their position in governance then we’re going to see these characters everywhere because it’s kind of like an identity in the community. So as you start voting on Snapshot, we can also roll out interfaces and take inspiration for the work that folks at NounsDAO are doing to kind of participate with your Banny and lean in to the stuff WAGMI is doing to extend that even further.</p><p>@mieos: I just love the idea of getting the Bannyverse and these veBanny off the ground, but I can’t wait till the next DAO actually just uses the same implementation of voting and either uses WAGMI or somebody else to create these stake tokens. I’m excited about this rolling out to other Juicebox projects and creating value from.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-product-roadmap-by-aeolian">4. Product Roadmap by @aeolian:<a class="hash-link" href="#4-product-roadmap-by-aeolian" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>@jango: The veBanny stuff is great but we can’t ship it yet because we don’t have V2 tokens up yet. And all the stuff that’s up depends on the V2 JBX being out. So we’re in a transition period of V1-V2. We’ve got to transition the V1 JBX to V2 JBX, and we’re currently talking about a few designs to do it. Coming off product roadmap discussion we’ve been having in the strategy channel, we are gonna focus on making sure folks have an easy way to pay their V1 JBX to the treasury and get their V2 tokens in return, and making it easy for other projects like SharkDAO for instance, to do the same. That way we can get a lot of V1 projects who are still using their treasuries in earnest onto V2 and then build these new features on there their folks can use. So I think that’s the area of focus for the time being and there&#x27;s a couple of ways to go about it. Aeolian do you want to hit up the current thought process?</p><p>@Aeolian: Totally. Quickly from Peel’s perspective and the front end perspective, as jango has said, the immediate focus is getting this V1-V2 migration flow done, designed and implemented. There’s a few different ways to go about it and jango said some good ideas in the strategy channel which everyone can check out. That’s our immediate priority. So Peel is going to return to development life cycle which is going to basically in line with Juicebox funding cycle, we&#x27;re currently on FC#22, and the work we get loosely scheduled, everyone can check out here on our Github project.</p><p>There are 3 main things we’ve been working on:
V1-V2 migration flow,
coming up with solution for handles for V2 projects which includes cool crossover with ENS names,
some iterations on payout splits UX that making that a little more intuitive which is pretty exciting as well.</p><p>We will be focused on these for the next 2 weeks to one month, ironing out little bugs that have come up in V2 and refining experience alongside these big features.</p><p>And beyond that, we had really good discussions in the strategy channel. Definitely encourage everyone to come hang out there and drop ideas.</p><p>I think the overarching alignment is to figure out how to get more activities on the network and more long term oriented activities. I still think there’s a few obvious things that we can build initially that have surfaced, and one of those is the multi token payment terminal stuff. </p><p>“Roadmap is coming together in a loose way”.</p><p>@jango: Everything is great. It’s occurring to me that finding the transition between projects is fairly meaningful to right patterns or timeing or whatnot. It’s sometimes not just a matter of feature itself but where it fits compared to other things.</p><p>So all these little motivations can all play into the roadmap in an interesting way that certainly takes the high level metrics we care about into account. So it’s absolutely a luxury to have 4 or 5 really delicious projects on the finish line right now. But figuring out a way to actually take them through the finish line in a way that makes cohesive sense is gonna be a lot of fun and can take a lot of patience from a lot of folks who have been working on each of these projects. But I think many of them don’t really have and might find themselve wanting something if we don’t do another piece beforehand. If we try to do them all at the same time, it’s probably gonna be like everything somewhat half baked. We’ll revisit this discussion probably for 15-20mins in every Town Hall to give updates on where we are at.</p><p>I think this line of thinking at least makes cohesive sense from our current standpoint, but can always change over time.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5-nft-framework-by-tankbottomseth">5. NFT Framework by @tankbottoms.eth:<a class="hash-link" href="#5-nft-framework-by-tankbottomseth" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>(demo undergoing……)</p><p>I’m thinking maybe anybody can make the NFT and associate it with a project. But in the recent discussions, originally any NFT that came out of this system is tied to a project, but there’s a bunch of feedback with a basic point that lets people do just whatever they want to do. I’m really looking forward to Aeolian&#x27;s splits. The idea is making an NFT as a project owner or as a project contributor for a project to sell on the market place of Juicebox. There are everyone’s ideas to roll into advanced mode or simple mode. There can be instructions on image NFT, music/video NFT, and p5.js. </p><p>As you can see, it’s just a lot of stuff. If you want to learn what to do, you can go to the create mode, and basically go through a PFP, or p5js or music, then create your collection to redefine your asset, review and deploy it and then price it and attach it to a project.</p><p>@mieos: Where would a Juicebox project contributor who wants to send some money to a project go? Where would they go to purchase this NFT? How would that look?</p><p>@tankbottoms: For things that need to be minted, this area where you can contribute could be a tab where you can mint an NFT. There’s also the idea that makes a kind of landing page for a mint, then there’s also the idea to have a Juicebox marketplace like Jango did. There’s definitely more experimentation where it’s gonna leave. The core ideas are making this tool pretty fancy and giving projects the continuous reasons to get ETH going into the treasury. They don’t have to worry about the whole split thing at some point after they do their NFT thing, like how much you want to go to the treasury or go to your wallet. I think that would be super useful.</p><p>@mieos: I think the NFT capacity inside juicebox is gonna add a lot of functionalities for projects and sort of just simplify this heady shit for staking projects. And it’s just a lot and I think it just helps democratize getting contributors in the door and checking the boxes that make sure their project is strong and has all the utility. </p><p>@tankbottoms: I hope so. I mean I don’t wanna work on stuff after this ever again, just put in everything I know how that you can milk out of an NFT and the tool to simplify it. I think in advanced mode or simple mode, everything will have a lot of feedback in terms of how it actually gets implemented.</p><p>@mieos: I’m curious, Nicholas, do you have thoughts about this? You’ve seen a lot of projects roll out with NFT. Does this strike any chords inside you?</p><p>@jango: This is definitely a big thesis on how the community can derive more cash flow. But it’s kind of a self-contained project for the time being, for sure it will make its way to product, once a lot of these granular things get knocked out in the next several months. I think this project could certainly have life on its own, maybe on its own site for experimentation to start. I feel very confident about the product per se and it’ll be unfolded in due time. </p><p>@nicholas: That was really what I wanted to say. It’s so powerful and has so many tools in what you build. You’ve created all-in-the-best class creation tools in one tool. I know you’ve got ideas about on chain also, so it’s even like tools that barely exist and are separated from multiple products. If you are a generative artist, there’s a couple of things out there that you can use. There’s a few artblock clones, then there’s a manifold that has something, there are private companies that can work with you, is it good enough to be in direct competition with those things like a choice on people’s mind? Or is it like I want to do a Juicebox project and I want to fund it with NFT? I think the truth is probably it can do all of those things. I think probably just have it on its own site, as it’s going to be difficult to integrate elegantly. I want to think more about what interfaces make sense for it.</p><p>@filipv: I wonder, looking at this demo and the demo by Jmill earlier, if it makes sense to start implementing some form of project page customization for project creators where project creators say if they want to put NFT market interface on their project page can switch on something in the metadata and then can configure what they want to show on their pages?</p><p>@jango: If you look at the screenshots shared(below), I am very interested in the same idea. And I wonder if it’s gonna be self-contained in the idea of a payment terminal, so maybe instead of imaging the whole site as what you can bring your payment terminal which is basically a functionality to move funds into the treasury according to some means. The customization is at least scoped to that box, this is a mock that we’re still playing with ideas here.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/zh/assets/images/terminal-1f040785fced8f2393f1086812ce33d7.png" width="954" height="752" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>@filipv: I think this is so exciting for existing projects, I know so many projects, like SharkDAO, have spoken about doing NFT issuance on Juicebox. This is pretty crazy. I don’t think anything like this exists in general and something like this could really draw people into the Juicebox ecosystem. Like Nichola said, this is a combination of all of the best. And the fact that this is in Juicebox potentially is super super crazy.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="6-dune-dashboard-of-juicebox-logbook-share-by-twodam">6.

It has been responsible for some of the biggest names in crypto community fundraising, including ConstitutionDAO, AssangeDAO and MoonDAO. Funding and operating an NFT project with Juicebox is an especially effective way to leverage the protocol, providing massive benefits to both owners and their communities.

Basics of Juicebox<a class="hash-link" href="#1-basics-of-juicebox" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>Juicebox allows people and communities to crowdfund their project and give their contributors a stake as community tokens (ERC20) in return. Once funds have been raised, the protocol can be leveraged to automate payments from the treasury in a controlled, transparent and decentralized fashion. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-why-juicebox-nft-projects-are-better">2. Why Juicebox NFT projects are better<a class="hash-link" href="#2-why-juicebox-nft-projects-are-better" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>Juicebox NFT projects are a win-win for both communities and owners. There are countless ways you can configure your Juicebox project for your specific goals, but here’s a general strategy we recommend for NFT projects: </p><p>Instead of sending your NFT royalty fees directly to the owner’s wallet, you can send them to a shared treasury owned by your community. Upon buying an NFT (and paying the royalty fee), the new owners of your NFT’s would automatically receive an amount of your community tokens proportional to their purchase amount. The more someone pays for an NFT, the more tokens they receive. This gives your community members a formal and quantifiable stake in the shared treasury - your project as a whole. Your community could also contribute and gain stake in your project by just buying tokens, not necessarily having to own an NFT. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="for-communities">For communities<a class="hash-link" href="#for-communities" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="token-value">Token value<a class="hash-link" href="#token-value" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>You can use these tokens for anything you want, perhaps governance, raffles or exclusive access to future drops. But a unique feature of Juicebox is that it allows the option for these tokens to be redeemed by community members for a portion of your project’s treasury. As the pie grows over time, a contributor’s tokens will be worth more. Your community can gain on top of just the increase in value of their NFT’s.</p><p>Having a shared treasury is optional, however, and you could instead just have all royalty fees sent to the Juicebox project route straight to the creators. In this case, the token your community receives could not be redeemed for any ETH. </p><p><strong>Your community can gain on top of just the increase in value of their NFT’s.</strong></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="trust-and-transparency">Trust and transparency<a class="hash-link" href="#trust-and-transparency" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>Firstly, a properly configured Juicebox project makes rug-pulls impossible. You can give your community time to react before any changes to your funding and spending parameters take effect. </p><p>Additionally, your Juicebox page shows exactly how all your funds are flowing - how much and where it’s coming from, and where those funds are subsequently being spent. The only way funds can leave the treasury is by configuring and scheduling a payment, for which your community will always have time to react to. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/zh/assets/images/image1-26d67a61b9ceb1555aa19b1714143f81.png" width="1999" height="1013" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><em>Spending (left) and income (right) shown on a project’s Juicebox page</em></p><p>You may be asking, <em>“Ok I see the benefit for my community, but what’s in it for the owner?&quot;</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="for-owners">For owners<a class="hash-link" href="#for-owners" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="maintain-a-high-stake-in-your-project-using-the-reserved-rate">Maintain a high stake in your project using the Reserved Rate.<a class="hash-link" href="#maintain-a-high-stake-in-your-project-using-the-reserved-rate" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>If you choose the option of your token holders being able to redeem from a shared treasury, we should mention that as an owner you can control exactly how much stake you maintain of this treasury over time. The reserved rate allows you to keep a portion of all newly minted tokens. A 50% reserved rate means you will maintain a 50% ownership of treasury no matter how big your project gets. </p><p>This is mostly irrelevant if you don’t want a shared treasury and to simply route all funds into the project straight to creators. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="allow-for-people-to-contribute-to-your-project-without-buying-an-nft-and-therefore-raise-more-funds">Allow for people to contribute to your project without buying an NFT and, therefore, raise more funds.<a class="hash-link" href="#allow-for-people-to-contribute-to-your-project-without-buying-an-nft-and-therefore-raise-more-funds" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>This model opens up a massive and mostly untapped market of people interested in investing in an NFT project without necessarily buying an NFT. Whether it be too high of a floor price, not wanting to go through the whole selection/auction/listing process, or anything else, Juicebox opens the door of your project to these people through community tokens.</p><p>Consider if the projects like the Bored Apes had followed this model - how much more funds could the creators have raised as a result of people buying some stake worth less than the purchase price of a Bored Ape? </p><p>How much more funds could the <!-- -->[Bored Apes]<!-- --> creators have raised as a result of people buying some stake worth less than the purchase price of a Bored Ape? </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="automate-payments-to-key-members-of-your-team">Automate payments to key members of your team.<a class="hash-link" href="#automate-payments-to-key-members-of-your-team" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h4><p>If you’re going for the shared treasury approach, Juicebox allows you to pre-program specific distribution amounts from your treasury to any ETH address, e.g. pay vitalik.eth US$1000 every week. This saves the hassle of manually transferring funds to your team from your personal or shared multisig wallet. </p><p>Otherwise, as mentioned prior, you can simply route all funds from the project to creators and their teams. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-what-does-it-cost">3. What does it cost?<a class="hash-link" href="#3-what-does-it-cost" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>Up front, all Juicebox costs is gas. As of the 23th of May, it’s about US$150-200 worth of gas to launch your project, deploy your own ERC20 token and a payable ETH address for you to link your royalty fees to. Then, for any funds you end up withdrawing from your project’s treasury, you’ll pay a 2.5% fee to Juicebox. But, for this 2.5% cut of your payout distributions, you’ll receive Juicebox’s native token (JBX) in return at its current issue rate. Moreover, your fee will give you a growing stake of Juicebox’s expanding ecosystem and treasury. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>If this has already been enough information for one reading, feel free to tap out now.

I learned about DAOs through Rare Pizzas and this guy named snax— who I gotta give a shoutout to ‘cause he’s the one who introduced me to DAOs— was buying free pizzas on pizza day. It was me and him and 2 other peeps on Clubhouse, and I was like this is stupid, no way this is gonna happen. As I got more comfortable in the DAO space, I eventually found my way to SharkDAO. I had started seeing these SharkDAO logos and I figured hey, I have a printing shop, I should make some hoodies with logos on them to give away, and I did (and they were expensive!). Jango and nicholas were people who helped guide me through sending out those hoodies, and so I got to know them and got to know JB. I decided to start making some JB clothing with graphics as well, and eventually I got put together with Zeugh and the talk was about community. I started helping wherever help was needed, like with governance, moving proposals along as they were coming in, etc. Eventually filipv jumped in and we started tag-teaming it and doing the podcast, which ran for a while.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="filipv-is-great-is-it-fair-to-call-you-two-the-gruesome-twosome">Filipv is great. Is it fair to call you two the gruesome twosome?<a class="hash-link" href="#filipv-is-great-is-it-fair-to-call-you-two-the-gruesome-twosome" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>We worked very closely together and he ended up taking on some huge responsibilities, but we still lean on each other a lot when it comes to opinions and direction. I would definitely say I’ve learned a ton from him and I think he would say the same. Every once in a while we’ll pick up the phone and call each other and just say “Hey, how you doin’?”.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-see-you-as-this-onboarding-wizard-where-did-that-start">I see you as this onboarding wizard, where did that start?<a class="hash-link" href="#i-see-you-as-this-onboarding-wizard-where-did-that-start" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>It’s definitely a roll I’ve grown comfortable doing. I remember doing onboarding with MoonDAO and Slice, and eventually then for JB. It’s also interesting that that sort of merged into this weird testing and feedback roll too. I found myself in the front-end chat more and more (I don’t know if I’m providing value there– I hope I am!) to try to test various things, launch projects on test net, find obscure bugs that are here and there and provide suggestions/feedback based on what the onboarding calls are giving me, so it’s kind of become a merged roll. Being in that close proximity to the user gives a lot of great insight and perspective.</p><p>I also think there needs to be a shield between the regular user and developers. I’m very adamant that there needs to be some distance there. I’ve always appreciated jango saying we’re all builders at JB, but let’s be honest, they’re (the devs) are the builders– the developers on the JB protocol side and the Peel Team, they’re really building and everyone else is providing support. Since I joined JB I’ve always felt the need to kind of protect the jangos of JB because they’re so hyper focused that distractions can lead to mistakes, and that can be a big problem. I think a lot of organizations should take on that approach, to be honest, to make sure those core builders are shielded from the basic questions that other contributors can answer. I feel like that’s where I slid right in, I can answer those questions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="im-reminded-of-high-level-athletes-and-how-theyre-trained-the-trainer-almost-has-to-take-a-caretaker-role-ensuring-that-distractionsobstacles-are-cleared-so-that-the-athlete-can-do-what-they-do-perform">I’m reminded of high level athletes and how they’re trained. The trainer almost has to take a caretaker role, ensuring that distractions/obstacles are cleared so that the athlete can do what they do: perform.<a class="hash-link" href="#im-reminded-of-high-level-athletes-and-how-theyre-trained-the-trainer-almost-has-to-take-a-caretaker-role-ensuring-that-distractionsobstacles-are-cleared-so-that-the-athlete-can-do-what-they-do-perform" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Exactly. It’s all about minimizing distraction. It’s interesting that you bring up athletics; I was a former athlete and after that have been involved in high level training— olympics, NCAA athletes— and the one thing I’ve carried on in my life moving into JB and other things is to eliminate distractions and be in the moment. If you are distracted about the outcome of something, you’re taking away energy from the task that you’re actually doing, and in athletics that could be the difference between a win and a loss, a championship and coming in second. It sounds super corny but launching new extensions has become that for me– that’s the championship, we gotta get there, how do we get there, how do we stay focused are the questions I have bouncing around in my head. I’ve always been an idea person— someone who can really thrive in environments where we’re talking about ideas— and I’ve always been good at that I felt, and JB is this crazy environment where people take ideas and build off of it into something else. It’s like a dream come true.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="there-almost-seems-to-be-a-hippy-spirit-at-jb-people-are-just-so-open-im-thinking-of-the-compensation-discussion-from-a-few-weeks-ago-just-an-open-discussion-no-one-at-each-others-throats">There almost seems to be a hippy spirit at JB– people are just so open. I’m thinking of the compensation discussion from a few weeks ago. Just an open discussion, no one at each other’s throats.<a class="hash-link" href="#there-almost-seems-to-be-a-hippy-spirit-at-jb-people-are-just-so-open-im-thinking-of-the-compensation-discussion-from-a-few-weeks-ago-just-an-open-discussion-no-one-at-each-others-throats" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Yeah, especially with a topic that’s been so sensitive our whole lives– we don’t talk about salary IRL, and to have this open dialogue is special. More so to have the validation that what you’re providing is worth the payout that you’re receiving– there’s no better feeling than that. Having the support of the community has been an amazing feeling for me. People don’t realize how important that is to me– to my personal being. It’s quite an experience and one that I don’t take for granted.</p><p>Regarding compensation, if you don’t pay the people who are irreplaceable, they’re gonna go somewhere else. I think that’s an important point. There’s also people within the DAO that are just completely connected to the DAO itself, like if jango leaves, or Drgorilla leaves, what is JB, or Peel, or what even happens to JB?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fair-question">Fair question.<a class="hash-link" href="#fair-question" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>I’ll tell ya right now– if jango decides to do another project, I would ask him if I can go with him. You just can’t replace certain people. So if you don’t pay them, they’re gonna be gone. All that said, I do think we need to be aware that we don’t have unlimited resourced. At the same time I think there’s enough people in the DAO that aren’t necessarily leaning on JB for all their bills/everything they do. So if there’s an emergency situation where people have to back off/reduce payout, I think we’ll see that happen.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-the-lack-of-assholes-and-mentally-checked-out-people-at-juicebox">Why the lack of assholes and mentally checked-out people at Juicebox?<a class="hash-link" href="#why-the-lack-of-assholes-and-mentally-checked-out-people-at-juicebox" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>I think because everyone at JB right now has proven their value, and people who haven’t don’t stay around for very long; they weed themselves out. I think there’s also a level of respect from each person that everybody kind of has each other’s back. If you come in and try to take advantage of the DAO, I think the community can read that like a book because we all had to pay our dues. Everyone who’s being paid recurring payouts has been told no at least once– that’s a common denominator we all have. I think when everyone’s gone through that there’s a level of respect and community, which you see in how we treat each other in our day-to-day.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="for-sure-okay-switching-gears-who-is-your-favorite-contributor-and-why-is-it-zeugh">For sure! Okay switching gears: who is your favorite contributor, and why is it Zeugh?<a class="hash-link" href="#for-sure-okay-switching-gears-who-is-your-favorite-contributor-and-why-is-it-zeugh" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Haha, I think Zeugh is great– he’s awesome!</p><p>You know, I don’t know who my favorite contributor is. I’ve worked closest with jango and filipv probably, but I’ve gotten to know the peel team a bit more and I’ve really enjoyed them asking me for feedback/allowing me to provide feedback. Right now I couldn’t answer who, I just love working with jango and filip– they definitely help me out and give me a strong feeling of purpose.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-something-somebody-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you">What’s something somebody would be surprised to learn about you?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-something-somebody-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>I think the biggest surprise would be… I have four kids! That is something that actually helps me with what I’m doing at JB– I’m good with time management/organization, and can make time for everything. My oldest son is really active with sports, so I’m juggling a lot, but even on the sidelines I’m always on the discord.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>标签：</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zh/blog/tags/dao">dao</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zh/blog/tags/interview">interview</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zh/blog/tags/juicebox">juicebox</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="博文列表分页导航"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/zh/blog"><div class="pagination-nav__label">较新的博文</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/zh/blog/page/3"><div class="pagination-nav__label">较旧的博文</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div></div>
