The question of “What’s next?” was an ongoing discussion to kick off the town hall, and the overarching question of how JB will orient itself was bounced back and forth between members. One current effort is around finding and fixing all the bugs one would expect when you roll out something as wide in scope and breadth as V2, which is an ongoing endeavor the devs are focusing on, particularly as they work to build out extensions that were previously not possible with V1.</p><p>Safe to say where JB finds itself today is quite incredible, and has etched out a presence and community known for providing an excellent tool that works and is powerfully scalable. The use cases solved for already have proven successful and powerful, and the discussion of what other future use-cases exist is ongoing.

A major thank-you to DrGorilla for making this possible and putting so much effort into the cause! </p><p>The way it works is, for example, if you have 1 million JBX, you can delegate it to someone with 3 million JBX, and that person will have 4 million JBX voting power. But if you do choose to vote later, their vote will decrease by that same 1 million, and your vote will be as strong as your own JBX (1 million). This is a flexible way that people can share voting power without sacrificing JBX or transferring it directly to one another.

We just got to the V2 milestone which is massive and there is natural inclination to add to what’s next. We have a bunch of projects in flight, as we discussed in last Town Hall.</p><p>There’s a lot of work going on and a lot of them are closing the finish line. They are probably not going to be in production at the same time, so we’ve got to figure out what our priority is and the way we think about prioritization going forward. Maybe we could just say we’ll do it next week once we get it more put-together, although it is solid as it is.</p><p><strong>@aeolian:</strong> </p><p>I think we can refine it a little bit. By next week, we probably will have a more solid plan before we actually gonna build. Yeah, we can leave it until next week.</p><p><strong>@jango:</strong> </p><p>I think the main thing is that there’s a lot of fun, powerful, shiny things in a lot of people’s work, which is about to have the possibility to come into fruition. For the time being, it’s quite clear what the priority is, that’s risk mitigation and making sure these small bugs that naturally have found themselves in a little bit to the product via this long stretch. There’s a couple of blaringly obvious pieces that the V2 has. </p><p>So in the short term, maybe a week or a few weeks, it’s really coming to terms with what those are and making those as clear as possible in the UI and then giving us an avenue to peel those back as we have known extensions, because almost all of the stuff is extension related. We can create the system to disclose one at a time appropriately. And it’s not a big shiny future but it’s pretty important. I think top priority with these things is to keep things from going to zero, kind of our job. </p><p>The 2nd priority is currently straight in the dark to increase the number of projects and the volume of payments. The good news is there is plenty of work we can do right now to stitch up the risk stuff and the bug stuff as we deliberate strategy. But as that gets wrapped up, then we’ll want to all be on the same page about what we&#x27;re trying to deliver next together.</p><p><strong>@aeolian:</strong> </p><p>I think it’s worth calling attention to the fact that it’s quite amazing Juicebox gets where it is. We should all have confidence at least from the UI perspective. When projects come along that kinda have the fire power, it’s able to really facilitate the payments. So it’s like, do we take this to the next level? What’s the next level? That’s really the point of the strategy channel and that document(<a href="https://www.notion.so/juicebox/juicebox-money-direction-b9bdac96c0f446a492ee76dee4faa4cf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>)and these discussions.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2brief-explanation-about-jbx-delegation-by-filipv">2.Brief explanation about JBX delegation by @filipv:<a class="hash-link" href="#2brief-explanation-about-jbx-delegation-by-filipv" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>We now have delegation on snapshot, so if you go to <a href="https://vote.juicebox.money/#/delegate/jbdao.eth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a>, you can delegate your JBX to other addresses for the snapshot voting. Tks for the amazing help from @drgorilla btw. Let’s say you have 1m JBX and you’re delegating to someone with 3m JBX, when they vote, they&#x27;re gonna have 4m JBX. But then if you vote after they voted, their vote will go down to their original 3m JBX, which means you still can vote on any proposal you want and they will lose your delegation, specifically on that vote. Right now this is working with both claimed and unclaimed JBX and then we’ll be moving over to the veBanny when it happens.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3work-report-by-twodam-on-new-dashboards-and-protocol-research">3.Work report by @twodam on new dashboards and protocol research:<a class="hash-link" href="#3work-report-by-twodam-on-new-dashboards-and-protocol-research" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>There is a new Dune dashboard made by twodam in <a href="https://dune.com/twodam/Juicebox-Gas-and-Fun-Facts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a>, in which you can find gas fee specification about setting up and managing a project in the protocol, as well as some fun facts such as “projects created per address”, or “ how many has an ENS” and so on.

Sometimes I try to find signals in these numbers. So I appreciate the readiness to take on new requests and make dashboards for things over time. It’s damn helpful.</p><p><strong>@twodam:</strong> I have made some dashboards and maybe I need to write some reports based on these data.</p><p><strong>@jango:</strong> I don’t know if VJ or Goldstein have worked using these dashboards but they created reports that might be based on your number, which I am actually almost certain they are. Like coming together and understanding how to distill these facts into narrative and we can use several people taking the steps like that. So yes please, I think VJ and Goldstein will keep doing that.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4community-and-market-cohesion-by-zeugh">4.Community and market cohesion by @Zeugh:<a class="hash-link" href="#4community-and-market-cohesion-by-zeugh" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p> It’s more of informing and getting opinions here. Since last time we decided collectively how we would be improving our community through the way we manage the server and things like documentation and onboarding, we have grown a lot. It has been a good while and now we have more than 3,000 new members and lots of new contributors. For those that maybe don’t know, CanuDAO, the DAO that I am paid through, is a working community here in Juicebox. </p><p>Lately I noticed and more people also have the feeling that in our whole marketing community, the way we communicated as a whole has not been as efficient as it could be because we don’t actually have coordination between ourselves. Last week, I talked to Felixander and Casstoshi to invite them into CanuDAO too. We have this model of having a separate DAO, like WAGMI and Canu, to make decisions and work things around to actually develop it as a service to Juicebox. But as it’s growing , it’s getting hard to get the cohesion, so I’m trying to get more people working on the community side here in Juicebox to get inside Canu too, so that we can have more specific time to talk about the Juicebox community together. </p><p>So this is to inform all of you that Felixander and Casstoshi have come in, in a way that we can communicate better like in SEO(Search Engine Optimization), pulp writing, community management. It’s also an invitation for anyone that is dedicating their time in Juicebox to work community part to also join Canu, to come to our meetings where we can have more time to discuss perspectives, to discuss what we’ve been seeing and ideas we’ve been having in Juicebox so that we can go back and deliver better community management. I feel as the community grows and  the roles for keeping the community healthy get bigger, but Canu didn’t get bigger at the same speed.  The tasks and everything expanded and Canu kept at the same size.</p><p>We’re about to renew our payout proposal in the next cycle, so this would be a good moment for people doing community stuff and wanting to get paid through Canu. It’s more of an invitation and explanation of the reason for this invitation.</p><p><strong>@filipv:</strong> For someone like Matthew and Briley who have recurring payout and work directly for Juicebox, what advantages are there to work for Canu? Or are you talking more about coordination？</p><p><strong>@Zeugh:</strong> Not necessarily I am moving payouts to Canu, for some it makes sense, for others it doesn’t. It’s okay to join Canu no matter if you get paid through it or not. I think it’s gonna be important now that the V2 is out, and efforts in my perspective are to onboard new people and new projects, to help people coordinate and cohesion can be of great value here.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5macro-environment-and-morgansterns-ice-cream-shop-event-by-jango">5.Macro environment and MorganStern’s Ice Cream shop event by @jango:<a class="hash-link" href="#5macro-environment-and-morgansterns-ice-cream-shop-event-by-jango" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="macro">Macro:<a class="hash-link" href="#macro" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>As we’re all aware, the treasury has decreased in dollar value quite a bit with Ethereum events in the market. It doesn’t affect our day to day activity, just in a sense affects our horizon. I think what we can expect going forward, obviously we can’t control what happens on a big picture scale, but running a fundraising platform does encourage us to continue to bring insights to each other over time from the perspective of how capital is being managed in macro. Looking at the runway we have, it’s a good opportunity to reflect on our mission and really focus on it. I think we’re at a comfortable place and we can certainly keep on for a while longer even if the access to capital affects us, which will affect all the projects on the platform and subsequently our revenue stream. Even if things were to slow down in a couple of years, we will still be comfortable in the runway&#x27;s perspective if we manage the treasury appropriately. These are the things to keep in mind when we’re thinking about prioritizing the initiative that we’re trying to further.</p><p>There are a lot of things that are very fundamental and core to our commission statement that I think we’ll have no problem continuing to further for the next long while. During any downturn of the market, it’s yield and liquidity that tend to dry up while they were pretty accessible before, so we have an opportunity to recognize that we are a funding platform, there’re a lot of people now that are maybe venturing somewhat into the unknown, into new opportunities and having to retreat into their fundamental convictions of what they want to do in the projects they think are important in the moment. I think really understanding the powerful projects that we can fund are not only going to be sustainable through whatever macro environment we find ourselves in, but also maybe these kinds of projects are gonna define the future market cycles or future building cycles. </p><p>I’ve put up a proposal to revisit the DAO Foundation document, reading through it and what we verified in the past still feels honest and great. It’ll be nice to go in the upcoming governance cycle. I want to make sure we’re committing ourselves and that we’re willing to spend sources on that.  We feel very serious about these things and that mission statement feels very sincere. We are indeed willing to work through whatever resources we have available to accomplish these things but realizing that things could be worse and there’s sacrifice that have to be made. But we also have to be in tune with the fact that this isn’t a project that reads similarly to other web2 related startups. </p><p>I think a lot of ways in which we use the treasury funds can be used to help projects start up and build during this time. I think these can be among the more powerful projects to emerge. Whether we do it collectively through DAO funds or we do that through individuals who are getting payout from the DAO in recognition of their work, is still up in the air. It’s way easier to support individuals as we have been doing it in the unit of ETH sent out per unit of dollar denominated payout, which is greater now for theoretically each of us are getting payout have more ETH overtime. It’s totally up to you what you’ll do with that, but it’s an opportunity to recognize here our job isn’t necessarily cut. It is just to recognize what our roles here are, looking for one building and we’re the ones helping (recording lost for a while)</p><p><strong>@mieos:</strong> Do you think it’s worth revisiting the redemption rate? If capital preservation is the thing the DAO is interested in, maybe retching that up just to touch might be useful and disincentivizing. We’ve probably gone through a bulk of the redemption, and I think it might be worth revisiting it but curious what other people think.</p><p><strong>@jango:</strong> That’s the obvious one. Thanks for bringing that up. That’s an easy one to do on the surface to help protect funds, though it kinda lowers the floor price which is held up great. That mechanism is one of the standouts of the current JBX implementations and we can definitely use it here.</p><p><strong>@mieos:</strong> I think it’s also worth mentioning just as a bit of anti-fud that the general theme during bear market cycles that if we’re going to see one like the rest of crypto history has laid out, which I am skeptical of, is a great time to build and thankfully we’re building a piece of software as a tool for people who are trying to build. </p><p><strong>@jango:</strong> I wouldn’t be surprised. I think it’s probable that the next while the market is continuing its current trend, we’ll see a lot less campaigns to purchase things at very high valuations, like a 50m constitution. But we’ll also see a lot of projects that are building long-term concepts, and I think that has been our thesis for a while now that the spotlight has been on the high raisers which make the project that’s earning 5ETH or 10ETH seem insignificant. But I think it’s those projects building things that last in business model that are going to shine through, and I don’t think there’s going to be thousands of ETH for these projects either. I wrote somewhere in the chat today, I think it makes a lot of sense that I bring it up here again. I encourage each of us to find 1, 2, 3, 4 projects around over time, led by people you particularly believe in or come to believe in, and add yourself in that project, and really figure out what they need to be successful. They probably come out from one perspective and maybe lack the resources, information or technology to do other parts of the project. We don’t need to do all in the same project, and I’m sure we’ll see each other around in all kinds of Discords helping things come into fruition. I think being hands-on and patient is going to pay off.</p><p><strong>@filipv:</strong> I think,  if anything, this could galvanize us further into building out both tooling, storytelling and communication in such a way that really emphasizes Juicebox’s capability for long term treasury management for treasuries that evolve. </p><p><strong>@mieos:</strong> I think it’s probably the best time in history for the best part of crypto to grow and become valuable, and the worst part of crypto to kinda slowly back into the shadows a little bit. That was a really loud bull market with a lot of madness, which certainly is not the reason why I’m here. I’m excited to build out some of the promises that the Ethereum has to offer.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="morgansterns-ice-cream-shop-event-during-nft-nyc">Morganstern’s Ice Cream shop event during NFT NYC:<a class="hash-link" href="#morgansterns-ice-cream-shop-event-during-nft-nyc" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p><strong>@kenbot-studiodao:</strong> Morganstern’s Ice cream is in downtown on the low east side. It’s always featured in all kinds of TV series, like Billions, and a totally iconic destination in downtown NY. He makes all kinds of flavors of ice creams, and he wants to make some custom flavors for the promotion so there would be some Juicebox oriented banana flavor that we can have some conversation with. At the same time last year, it was something like a prototype that if you have a token, you can get access to secret sandwiches not on the menu. This year, he’s going to do a burger pop-up with an incredible burger chef who’s nationally famous. So this would be like tagging along and building something for Juicebox where we can onboard people in real time in a special session of the shop he would hold for us.</p><p><strong>@jango:</strong> </p><p>NFT NYC is a Monday - Thursday event, so we’ll block off a chunk of time from around noon till 6pm, which is the prime time for people in NYC to stop by and have ice creams and burgers. We could basically deck out the place in Banny, like you got Banny plastered in different places, you got ice cream flavors that Juicebox and Banny related. We can invite and meet up with folks whoever is in town.
Folks can stop by, and like Kenny said they have some criteria like onchain criteria of contributing to JuiceboxDAO or having JBX or being part of the project or whatever we decide, if we ship the veBanny in time, it should be veBanny locked position or whatever. You can get your ice cream on the house and we essentially have conversations like explaining what Juicebox is or talking to project owners. Eventually we can go through the onboarding thing. We can invite project creators to talk throughout the week who may have expressed interest in starting a Juicebox project, or transitioning an ongoing project onto Juicebox. </p><p>It’s like piggybacking what Morganstern’s is already doing as well as the NFTNYC and trying to flex our capability for Banny and Juicebox material into a hyper specific location, and meanwhile make it all about project creators.
The approximate budget would be around 10k for the week perhaps including free ice creams.
The DAONYC event by DAOplanet is on June 24 -25, right after the NFTNYC, so we might try to make the two events work together in some way.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="7quizz-time">7.Quizz time:<a class="hash-link" href="#7quizz-time" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>In the statements below, two are true, one is a lie.

When the question came up that a community manager was needed, I put my name out there.

There is a lot of time spent online in chats and severs, whether the Chinese chats to try to understand community issues, or in other servers to learn new tools they’re using, practices they have, and how they engage/reward/manage a sustainable growth.</p><p>Lately we’ve pushed hard on trying to automate governance with guys like filipv, Phytann, jigglyjamz, lazervike and others, and Canu has been heavily involved in this as well.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-has-it-been-like-working-with-the-chinese-community-and-their-role-at-jb">What has it been like working with the Chinese community, and their role at JB?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-has-it-been-like-working-with-the-chinese-community-and-their-role-at-jb" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>It’s one of the better things that happened to JB ever, but at the same time definitely one of the biggest challenges. Bringing our Chinese members together in a governance process where we all get the power to decide what we do is a complex thing, but it’s exactly what makes us so critical and diverse in what we build. We have to do good stuff– not sensibly good to my taste or American or European tastes, or to Chinese tastes, but it has to be good stuff across the board. That’s very challenging to pull off, but at the same time we’re all a part of the community.</p><p>When the community first came, I remember I would jump in there with google translate to try to make sense of the chats going on in discord. Man, it was so suddenly so many new members, and we had to try to reach out and make those connections. It was an exiting and also exhausting time, especially since google translate can only do so much. I do have to say one of the members who has been a killer and God in moderating the Chinese community, getting them informed and engaged, is twodam. That guy is a beast and I appreciate him so much.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-idea-of-you-sitting-in-discord-with-google-translate-and-trying-to-understand-chinese-is-absolutely-hilarious-to-me">The idea of you sitting in Discord with google translate and trying to understand Chinese is absolutely hilarious to me.<a class="hash-link" href="#the-idea-of-you-sitting-in-discord-with-google-translate-and-trying-to-understand-chinese-is-absolutely-hilarious-to-me" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Let me tell you— now we have the translate bot. It automatically translates. But that day when we got that huge influx of members, it was 3am and my phone starting beeping, beeping, beeping, and I was like ok, silent mode, I’m not working tonight, this is my one night off.</p><p>But it didn’t stop! So I got back to my comp and there were more than 1k new members, all of them Mandarin speakers, and all were over every channel– and up to that day we didn’t have a single Mandarin channel, so I spent the whole night with google translate writing FAQs, basic guides on how to solve the most common questions, translated hundreds of Q’s and ranked them with what were the most relevant answers, and I think it was nicholas and someone else who was in the twitter spaces that joined and were able to pitch in and help. Shout out to those guys and everyone who helped early on with that, it was such a huge task and everyone stepped up. Eventually we even found some university students from the US that we knew who were Chinese and we asked them to translate asap, and that helped a lot too. Now we have really amazing translator teams, the of course the amazing twodam who kills it every day, and so we’ve found a good stride.</p><p>Twodam is amazing, I can’t say enough good things. He ended up in this position of managing the greatest share of governance (by population) and is doing it incredibly well. I’m about convinced that twdam is a team– not a guy, a whole team– because the guy does contracts, community, translates, I mean he’s absolutely incredible.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="where-are-all-the-assholes-at-jb">Where are all the assholes at JB?<a class="hash-link" href="#where-are-all-the-assholes-at-jb" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>That’s a very good question, actually. The main thing on that that fascinates me is that I’ve spent countless hours crunching analytics data on our conversations, running our bots, and so far I haven’t found them either. Idk why, but they are just not around I guess. The funny thing is we’re in the crypto space— people being obnoxious is like breakfast, but somehow at JB we don’t attract these kinds of people.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-something-somebody-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you">What’s something somebody would be surprised to learn about you?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-something-somebody-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>I was a comp sci undergrad for 3 years, that’s when I first heard about crypto, and even so it took me 5 years to ever engage in my first transaction (which was in bitcoin!) to actually get into crypto because I was completely against burning the amazon. I was a very critical person of crypto for a good while. I was misinformed.</p><p>I get addicted to hobbies; 2 years ago I was living in a small house in the middle of the woods. I spent about one year living there, talking to my cats or the monkeys who would come to try to steal my food. I was developing digital products and tending to the gardens since I love gardening. I loved the nature, the no-plastic environment, just me and plants, no eating meat. That passed now, I’m back to the animal eating part of life and living around big buildings and concrete and using plastic bags, but that was definitely a life-changing part of my last few years.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-what-changed-the-amazon-can-just-burn-to-the-ground">So what changed?

I was living in the middle of nature trying to find out how possible it was for someone living in society to have the smallest impact in nature– that was the goal of going there– to see how simple/non-violent towards nature I could live without leaving behind civilization and a modern world. I started reading everything I could in every area, so I learned a huge amount and cleared up a lot of misconceptions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fascinating-whos-your-fav-contributor-and-why-is-it-zom_bae">Fascinating.

I think this gets me into a tight spot here. Although Zom_Bae is terrific, I don’t think I can give her the prize without sharing it with filipv and twodam. I will not even include jango in this one just because that is obvious.</p><p>I can’t choose man, I have the blessing of a very amazing team to work with. If I had to pick, I would share my favorite contributor in four people– Filip, Jango, Twodam, and Zom_Bae. If I had to pick one, I’d go with Zom_Bae. She’s amazing. And the red rocket banny pfp! Zom_Bae does wonders in lots of micro areas around JB community - I would not trust anyone more than her nowadays to be the one who receives and onboards both partners and community members, contributor-wannabes, and everyone in between who needs guidance to navigate our complex environment.</p><p>jango has always been a steward for good culture, has always been bringing some perspectives of open criticism/honest debate since the beginning.</p><p>Filip is a monster– a complete gigabrain going from governance to some automation here and there and finding good minds to help every single area he touches– there’s not an issue I don’t se him going around. Twodam I’ve talked about more than anyone in this inteveriew– it’s well deserved. Bridging two different communities while also building data queries to better observe community trends, and making it look effortless, it’s just amazing…</p><p>But then there’s Mieos and Sage with WAGMI studios and all the vibes– Sage is definitely underrated! A huge shout-out to her and the vibes that we get from Banny and that we get from all the juicy fruits that she brings to life with her art.

I’m kind of a workaholic; I engage a good part of my hobbies like they’re work. I played (semi-professionaly) League of Legends for a while. Very low-tier stuff though.</p><p>I love gardening. I used to have an ant farm; I would catch ant queens in mating season and I started my own ant farm. I raised some ants.</p><p>My hobby is changing hobbies– I have 3-month sprints where I have hyper-focus in something, study a lot and research a lot, get super nerdy, and then I move on to the next thing. I’ve been through organic chemistry– making my own hygiene products. Star wars– reading all I could in the expanded universe. Wicca magic. Cocktails.

What’s the favorite thing you’re looking forward to?<a class="hash-link" href="#thats-awesome-whats-the-favorite-thing-youre-looking-forward-to" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>I’ll have to split the answer in two. The first - watching how crypto changes the world. I’m gonna play a part and I want to play the best part I can. I used to say in my twitter, “I am here to make sure the next big social network is not owned by a corporation, but is co-owned”. I want to see the power of open data, public ledgers, collective ownership over the digital assets that currently rule over people’s days most of the time, and so much more. I want to watch as that unfolds and try to play a part, and I think it will happen in a massive way.</p><p>As for myself, I’m really really keen to creating those bridges between people building stuff and people that need stuff built. I’ll be going nomad for a while and traveling to try to find a way to get a local communities to organize and find solutions through the tech they’re creating. Local communities are powerful and we’re finally at a point where digital communities are also hitting that kind of strength. If we can merge local and digital communities we can really change things. When the people making products, the politicians making promises, etc., are also the people who are living in a community, they can’t just say they’ll do things and not do them. Suddenly there is accountability, and things get better. I want to build a solar-punk future. It sounds crazy, but I used to say, “I’m not crazy, I’m just hopeful.”</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>标签：</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zh/blog/tags/dao">dao</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zh/blog/tags/interview">interview</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zh/blog/tags/juicebox">juicebox</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/zh/blog/questions-concerning-compensation">Questions Concerning Compensation</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-05-11T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">2022年5月11日</time> · <!-- -->5 分钟阅读</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/realfelixander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1509677708854239233/Bsru0Xks_400x400.jpg" alt="Felixander"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/realfelixander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Felixander</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Community Member</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>As many of you may have noticed, the question of compensation has come up recently in the discord (linked <a href="https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/963551788823375932/963551856091627522" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). It was an exceptionally valuable discussion that really highlighted how tricky the question concerning compensation is, both at JB specifically and in the web3 DAO space as a whole.</p><p>Central to this question and perhaps a source of equivocation is this: what precisely is Juicebox?</p><p>People looking at Juicebox like a startup, assuming it will exist like startups in the web2 world, may be quick to advocate for low salaries. After all, you don’t want high salaries if you are looking to pump up value in a company that you want to sell. This is the case with classic startups that are seeded with VC and created with the intent of profit as their final goal.</p><p>But you can also look at Juicebox like a grass-roots company– still profit driven, but not looking to sell. This would be in-line with your classic examples of companies that went big– think Bill Gates dropping out of college to create Microsoft, or Mark Zuckerberg doing the same with Facebook. In these cases, the goal was not to pump value and then sell; rather, the goal was to build first, and only after that to reap the rewards down the line. When Mark Zuckerberg made facebook, Myspace was the biggest name in town. In a few short years, it became an afterthought, and Mark Zuckerberg became the reptilian overlord we know him as today. He was in it for the long-haul, and it paid off for him.</p><p>And finally, you can look at Juicebox as a community. In this schema, it’s a collection of people all pulling in the same direction. The people who see Juicebox this way are quick to tell you that profit doesn’t really enter their minds too much, nor does a potential long-term promise of riches and private yachts. Rather, these people just like the people, the vibe, and the sense of being a part of something greater than themselves.</p><p>All this a long-winded way to point out that, if we ask the three people above about compensation, we’re likely to get three very different answers. Furthermore, we’re even more likely to equivocate the word at hand.</p><p>For instance: at Juicebox, are we compensating for services rendered, or are we acknowledging people’s efforts <em>through</em> compensation? Are we disbursing funds based on how profit-driven companies pay their employees, or are we giving pieces of the pie, ie JBX, to stake future promise and voice into our contributors? And in either case, how are we valuing contributors based on their roles differently?</p><p>And then there is a question of effort spent working– that is, is it even fair to tie compensation to how hard one works. Take for instance classic capitalist models. You may know someone who works hard and makes 50k per year. You may know someone who works hard and makes 200k a year. You may wonder if one person is truly working “harder” than the other. Maybe so, maybe not. But then take Elon Musk, who is worth 300 billion dollars, give or take. Is it fair to say that, in comparison to our 200k-per-year example, Elon is working 1.5 million times harder? Or compared to our 50K example, that he’s working six million times harder? We see from this reductio ad absurdem that equating value with how hard one works tends toward fallacy.</p><p>And so we arrive back and square one. What is compensation, truly? What is fair compensation? Is comparison the thief of joy, or should we look to others to determine our own worth? Marx said: from each according to his ability, to each according to his need. An honor system in other words– I am a contributor doing X in a city where I need Y to live comfortably, and I’m asking for Y. Is this the solution– a commune where wealth is shared according to what people self-report they need? It doesn’t take a much to point out the room for abuse there.</p><p>Perhaps this is the central point: complicated, worthwhile endeavors are messy. There aren’t simple answers to these questions, and there shouldn’t be. The fact that we’re doing something worthwhile is underpinned by the fact that we’re even having these conversations, and so authentically and transparently at that. Like great art, you can’t expect people to come away agreeing that this discussion means the same thing, or that it’s solved. But what can be said is that our attitude toward the discussion should reflect ourselves authentically, and should show our steadfast determination to working together, to community and to teamwork. Oscar Wilde said, “A cynic is a man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.” We should take these words to heart and resolve to never get lost in just the numbers.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>标签：</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zh/blog/tags/dao">dao</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zh/blog/tags/soapbox">soapbox</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/zh/blog/2022-05-11-town-hall">2022-05-11 Town Hall Summary</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-05-11T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">2022年5月11日</time> · <!-- -->13 分钟阅读</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/zhape1112" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1522548586734444544/K661H-eb_400x400.jpg" alt="Zhape"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/zhape1112" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Zhape</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">JuiceboxDAO Contributor</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-intro">1.

Front end update from @aeolian:<a class="hash-link" href="#2-front-end-update-from-aeolian" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>We had another good week, and pretty much on track for a Mainnet launch in the next 3-4days. We started a feature freeze 36h ago, which means not merging anything unless it’s a critical bug, none of which is found, to allow us to merge a big PR that supports a new subgraph. New subgraph is currently indexing the mainnet, now it’s a waiting game that needs logical coordination to get things to happen. Once that’s in, we are basically ready to launch V2 on mainnet. The good thing is, that the launch is not a one-way door, if we have major issues, we can always switch back to V1 to fix the issues and switch back to V2 after that. It has been a much bigger effort than we all imagined, but it is now coming to a close here.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-quick-inventory-check-by-jango">3. Quick inventory check by @jango:<a class="hash-link" href="#3-quick-inventory-check-by-jango" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Not sure if it’s useful but I think the past few days after V2 has been up, folks have been more future and forward looking. There’s been a lot of ideas coming up that people are prototyping and playing with. Sometimes people are in tune with things happening while sometimes not. I just want to make sure that we all somewhere are aware of what’s on our mind and where different projects are at.</p><p>1) V2 contracts (deployed) : V2 contracts have been shared quite a few times in Town Hall. These have been deployed in the 4th iteration which is feeling great. So, our products are basically done in their initial capacity and in the needs of contracts. I just want to make sure it’s communicated out enough so folks know how to use it.</p><p>2) Docs (deployed, iterating): The docs are started by @filipv and a bunch of stuff has been added from a technical perspective. Those are done as well and constantly iterated on.
@filipv: I am very excited to help centralize a lot of resources to build extensions to the protocol, and it is like a repository of information about everything related to Juicebox).
@jango: Big shouts for helps in setting that up in the beginning and shouts for WAGMI studio, @sage and @mieos for starting to create a whole-worldly vibe for what a repository of higher knowledge could look like.</p><p>3) Fee extension (formalizing): This is a solution to use V2 tooling to route incoming payments to JuiceboxDAO to best yielding places for JBX, on AMM or first party issuance mechanical. It is looking great and we are wrapping up tests and playing with optimization, kind of in a formalizing stage.</p><p>4) veBanny contracts (formalizing): This is a way of staking JBX for an NFT ve position, which is locking your JBX over time to have a new kind of accounting primitive to use for governance. I hope we can align decision-making with a longer term community interest in this way. Alongside it, a lot of art is being experimented by the WAGMI team, tankbottoms and natasha. This job is also being formalized, we are trying to piece together, according to CURVE ve contracts, how we might do delegation in this scheme. It’s very promising.</p><p>5) V1→V2 migration terminal (prototyped, formalizable): Once V2 is up, projects can have a V2 token issued if they choose to operate on V2 as well as V1, which is what JuiceboxDAO will do. We are going to prototype a terminal where the V2 treasury will accept the V1 treasury token as payment and issue its V2 version one for one (1:1). It, to some extent, works within the mental model of how Juicebox treasuries are working, and we are trying to manage the migration in that way.</p><p>6) NFT market (prototyped): It is a topic that has been lingering for a while and happened in conversations quite many times and might be on the horizon. It’s a set of contracts that allow folks to list NFT with the sales routed through a particular Juicebox treasury or a set of treasuries. The goal of this project is, instead of having the pay button as the way to pay projects, anyone could upload an NFT that could basically serve as the pay button. Someone could just buy the NFT and the funds would be routed to the treasury. This is in effect a more engaging pay button that is extended to do the NFT related treasury things. This is also prototyped, and it seems we also have a few prototypes from @tankbottoms as well. It still need some design iterations.</p><p>7) V2 versioning fire drill (prototyping): There’s an idea floating around once we get V2 up to sooner rather than later organize how versioning might work on V2, like we might deploy subsequent version of the payment terminal V2, which is a feature of V2 as hyperforkability. People can roll their treasuries and migrate between terminals. Might be interesting to be right off the bat, before some happenings or pressure, to migrate from one terminal to another slightly optimized one. This is not really a big deal but more so to get the cadence of feeling confident in how we might organize files. It’s not an urgent matter, but we should think of doing it instead of waiting till things get chaotic and we’re driven by necessity to migrate, by then things tend to be more delicate.</p><p>8) 1:1 terminals for L2 strategy (pre-prototyping): The L2 strategy allows projects to manage treasuries on not just mainnet but any other L2, then to have their tokens organized across chains, taking redemption into account, etc. There is a good design for it, it just needs to be prototyped. </p><p>9) Subscription terminal (pre-prototyping): It’s not really worth touching on but @jigglyjam brought up a cool use case that might be fun to sail for.</p><p>10) Juicebox reverse ENS registry (pre-prototyping):With the V2 tool box available, front end brought up a good point regarding Juicebox reverse ENS registry. In V1 we had handles for projects which is great in the short term, but it has a whole lot we need to think about for a long-term perspective. In V2, we just started with project IDs, so that people can build things on top of it. Front end has already accommodated ENS support for projects to use as URLs to access their treasury, but there’s couple of things in the UI that need to be nicer if there&#x27;s an additional Juicebox reverse ENS registry. </p><p>11) Treasure hunt:
@mieos has been working on a treasure hunt on cryptovoxels.com which is pretty exciting.
updates on treasure hunt by @wackozacco:
We are trying to experiment to coordinate something special with V2 promotion. Please go to the 3rd floor of the parcel, where there are clues for seed phrases of the treasure chest. There is already 150k JBX inside the wallet. After V2, @mieos will set up another discord to give clues for the decoder. We try to plan some more scavenger hunt type of things.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-nance-bot-by-jigglyjams">4.

We are trying to make everyone aware of what’s happening, say it out loud the priorities, and see how to nudge each other towards bringing things over the finish line one at a time. Surely everything is making an impressive progress over the past months, some of them are really hefty projects that are not easy to spec out let alone bring it to the finish line.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="6-presentation-by-tankbottoms-and-filipv">6. Presentation by @tankbottoms and @filipv<a class="hash-link" href="#6-presentation-by-tankbottoms-and-filipv" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>In general, this presentation talks about different objectives based on the foundation which is helping people confidently run programmable and community fund treasuries, from start to scale openly on Ethereum.</p><p>A lot of people are using Juicebox so far because these are short term project instances which Juicebox is amazing for. You go to the website and in a minute you can have a treasury set up with the project’s page. But a lot of projects are more oriented towards longer term development, and would want to have their own website and an interface custom suited to what they need to do. Something @aeolian brought up today is super valuable in building out different libraries of components which makes it super easy for projects like Flamingo or Muse0 to interface with the Juicebox protocol.</p><p>Part of enabling people to build longer term oriented projects is to help approach legal things in a way that makes people more confident. We can add terms of use and a privacy policy for juicebox.money and other front end. And we are also working with dao-lawfirm.eth, the one @tankbottoms is working with, to set up some accessible packages for Juicebox projects and potential templates and generic policies which will hopefully help people build on Juicebox with more legal peace of mind.</p><p>Another idea is to bring in some DEFI capability by using some of the functionalities that V2 provides and we can start by doing stablecoin, overtime we can work with different services providers to set up bot terminals which people can add as a payout and then be able to interface with different DEFI protocols. If JuiceboxDAO is focused on treasury management for DAOs with long term orientation, being able to diversify and split ETH into a bunch of stuff is probably more attractive than just keeping ETH in the treasury in terms of minimizing risk.</p><p>Another part will be genesis NFT creation. I just did the pull request for the NFT delegate. The first 100 people that contribute to your project should get an commemorative NFT or people who contribute more can get the NFT. The delegate is a new function or a feature in V2 that executes an arbitrary smart contract or basically does whatever you want whenever someone pays or redeems with a Juicebox treasury. </p><p>Q: When this stuff is implemented, how much longer is it to launch a project? Are you going to have the option to not use these things by bypassing them, like, if i don’t want them but just something simple, can I click a button to bypass?</p><p>@filipv: I wonder if it makes sense to implement these things as an optional library or even on a separate website from the main juicebox.money interface. If you want to do NFT, you can go to the other website.</p><p>There are a ton of functionalities tank has been working on. Like this NFT market is to some extent extending the functionality of minting NFT which projects can use, and contributions on the market place can be sent to the DAO treasury. </p><p>The bot terminal basically creates treasuries which will interface with different DEFI protocols and we can create custom strategies to diversify assets and to manage treasury as easy as adding another payout. What’s great is that there is no fee in between projects in V2. The idea is to make it sticky and make people want to build in Juicebox because it’ll give them access to these tools such as NFT and DEFI stuff like that. First these are built for JuiceboxDAO, but eventually hopefully will be accessible to the entire ecosystem.</p><p>@jango: We should continue to go out and prioritize and try to refactor until the right way  to present it to folks, in a way that preserves the users’ focus as they are trying to find out how to set up projects and achieve certain things. I am curious how you see a lot of these new features playing in one place because a lot of mocks belong to juicebox.money or navigatable from the same UI. Maybe this is a question that we should keep in mind as a group going forward. There are going to be some competing for space in the interface, or competing for attention. </p><p>@filipv: In my opinion, one super valuable work flow would be to compartmentalize all of these into APPs. we can build this library of extensions in the Juicebox protocol. If you want to use it for your project, you can click “add”, and people can put in their custom contract. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="7--on-gorilla-marketing">7.  On Gorilla Marketing:<a class="hash-link" href="#7--on-gorilla-marketing" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>@filipv: I want to mention the Gorilla marketing that @Zeugh is up to. There’s a lot of discussion of physical presence at conferences. I think it has a lot of potential. Anyone interested can reach out to us.</p><p>@Zeugh: That’s something I am excited for. I’ve been talking a little more this week with @felixander and @casstoshi about joining some forces to make it better by integrating gorilla marketing, pulp writing and search optimization. I believe we are going to have some nice news soon on getting better visibility. I was reading about treasure management, talked with @twodam, @jango and @drgorilla about the runway we have in ETH. And one of the solutions I believe is to get more projects inside and make that treasury grow. So ETH goes down, treasury goes up. It makes a whole lot of sense to me that marketing, writing and visibility can play a good part in that.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="8-on-user-flow">8. On user flow.<a class="hash-link" href="#8-on-user-flow" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>@filipv: Does anybody have any thoughts on user flow, and what that would look like as these extensions are built out?</p><p>@jango: I am gonna say these are gonna come together over several weeks. This will continue to be a topic in subsequent town halls. We will keep revisiting.</p><p>@nicholas: I think maybe it’s interesting to think the creation flow could be people coming from very different points of view. We may be having an easier time building a treasury set up for their use cases. Then maybe those are rolled into this modular interface content. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="9-quizz-time">9.

This article recaps some of the main points discussed. Also a huge shout-out to Zhape for his excellent on-the-fly translations!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="translation-needs">Translation needs<a class="hash-link" href="#translation-needs" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>The translation efforts are coming back underway as JB has overhauled its documents over the past few weeks. One area of concern was in how to best achieve accurate translations that can be written engagingly. The need for accurate translators, particularly who are comfortable working from English to Chinese, was underscored by Zhape. If you are comfortable translating into Chinese fluently and would like to contribute to translation efforts, reach out to Zotico in the #translation channel.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="guerilla-marketing-campaign-and-community-building">Guerilla Marketing Campaign and Community Building<a class="hash-link" href="#guerilla-marketing-campaign-and-community-building" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Zeugh gave a brief highlight of some intended efforts at marketing and community building. Currently, there have been discussions to send some Juicebox contributors to Crypto or NFT conferences where they can network and spread the word about Juicebox. Possible eventual speaking opportunities at conferences, or sponsorships of conferences, are also being discussed, but at the moment the goal is to start small and see if we can spread the word about Juicebox and make meaningful connections between communities, or create opportunities for people to open projects on the Juicebox platform.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="translating-outreachcommunity-content">Translating outreach/community content<a class="hash-link" href="#translating-outreachcommunity-content" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>One area discussed was the importance of trying to make it a priority to translate into Chinese blog posts, interviews, or other materials that will help bridge the gap between our Chinese-speaking and English-speaking communities. For instance, an article such as this one that simply updates the community at large on a recent discord call, or an article that announces major changes coming with V2, would be excellent opportunities to inform our Chinese-speaking readers and to open the opportunity to gain feedback from them.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-state-of-v2">The state of V2<a class="hash-link" href="#the-state-of-v2" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>jango gave some insights on how the V2 protocol is coming along. Front-end of the protocol is still under development and coming along nicely, and in the mean time fine-tuning measures in the back-end continue to ensure a smooth rollout. The V2 protocol will allow many creative opportunities to build extensions, and offer more tools to project creation. So far early reception has been very good.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tokenomics-strategies">Tokenomics strategies<a class="hash-link" href="#tokenomics-strategies" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>The question of how tokens should be disbursed, traded and valued also came up. The goal of ensuring that a project received the best rate of JBX per ETH is being discussed and worked on. Practically, this would mean that if a better JBX rate existed from an AMM, a project creator would receive that rate JBX at the AMM exchange rate. While JBX currently has low liquidity, one line of thinking is that such a system, which would necessarily drive traffic to such AMM’s, would serve as a mechanism to build those liquidity pools. Importantly, the impetus for such a process starting will likely come as Juicebox incentivizes these opportunities.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="voting-equity">Voting equity<a class="hash-link" href="#voting-equity" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Another core topic of discussion was around voting equity in the current DAO governance. The question centered around how to strike a balance between early contributing members, such as jango, who have very large sums of JBX and thus have tremendous voting power, and members who may be contributing heavily but are newer, and thus have far lower voting power. This is a catch-22, but it is important to note that this imbalance is certainly aware to early contributors such as peri, jango and others. In the case of per and jango, they do not engage in voting for this reason (both were quick to point out). One solution is to continue issuing JBX, which will give more voting power to more individuals, but this also flies squarely against certain opinions to completely stop JBX issuance. It is a complex situation that has a lot of moving parts, and is inextricably linked to the JBX issuance/AMM situation mentioned above. Ultimately the thinking is that with these new changes, solutions may present themselves and we will see growth and directions in these domains.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="main-takeaways">Main Takeaways<a class="hash-link" href="#main-takeaways" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>This call provided important information and helped streamline communication between the English-speaking and Chinese-speaking Juicebox member communities. The nature of questions remained substantive throughout and finding a cadence to have such calls seems like a good strategy moving forward. A huge thank-you to our members, both English- and Chinese-speakers, for taking the time to hop on this call and for having such open and transparent discussions. And again a huge thank-you to Zhape, who translated and managed the discussion and kept a good flow going!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>标签：</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zh/blog/tags/dao">dao</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zh/blog/tags/news">news</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/zh/blog/where-are-they-now-filipv">Where Are They Now?

Results below!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="definitions">Definitions<a class="hash-link" href="#definitions" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>To fully comprehend the findings, it helps to quickly define the terminology used in our analysis.</p><p>Most of these findings centralise around a concept called the &quot;Retention Rate&quot;. The retention rate is defined as the <strong>lowest JBX balance for an address after the airdrop</strong>. To better understand this, let&#x27;s use an example:</p><p><code>0x123</code> claims 100 JBX tokens from the airdrop. They then go on to sell 30 of their tokens immediately after claiming. This address then waits a week, and buys back the originally sold 30 tokens. In this scenario <code>0x123</code> would have a retention rate of 70%, even after buying back the tokens, as it is the greatest amount of tokens sold after the claim.</p><p>This logic ensures that per address the retention rate can only go down over time.</p><p>The second concept to understand is the &quot;Average Retention Rate&quot;. Many of these graphs aggregate the retention rates across all claimers in the airdrop. The average retention rate is defined as <strong>the average of all the retention rates for all addresses whom have claimed already</strong>. So, again using an example, if 10 addresses claimed the airdrop each day, then the average retention rate on day 1 would only consider the first 10 address and not any of the addresses who claimed on day 2, day 3, etc.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="findings">Findings<a class="hash-link" href="#findings" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>The first graph shows retention rates 28 days after several major airdrops. The Juicebox Benefits Airdrop had unprecedented levels of hodling!</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/zh/assets/images/juicebox_retention_snapshot-f42d17e69558ce6505f0d04a86444e70.png" width="606" height="374" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The next graph also shows retention rates, but instead shows them over time. After a brief selloff, retention was remarkably stable.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/zh/assets/images/juicebox_retention_over_time-bb0d71c40e63731e296d0e4cbc4100a4.png" width="606" height="387" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Next, we consider this same retention rate over time broken down across the 3 different score chorts (see <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/jbdao.eth/proposal/0xd10c56f453851063665241417642352beaf8816aca062c29f98b1f5154ff3cdd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JBP-114</a>). Interestingly, the cohort with scores between 53-200 had the second highest retention rate, beating out the 201-300 cohort by ~15% at times.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/zh/assets/images/juicebox_retention_by_cohort-eae2713a86cbbff13df4d4de667b8b4a.png" width="606" height="387" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Finally, we looked at how quickly each cohort claimed their JBX. Interestingly, the 53-200 tier fared better than the 201-300 tier in this metric as well. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/zh/assets/images/juicebox_claims-925e755b482e0cdf2952d552faf16455.png" width="612" height="387" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Thank you to everybody who helped make this airdrop happen.

I’ve been in software development for a minute, and I met some anons who wanted to do this public good DAO, which is now called MovementDAO. It’s part seeding start-ups, part non-profit, part social movements.  In researching platforms to work with I found two which I liked the most, OpenLaw’s TributeDAO Framework and Juicebox. </p><p>TributeDAO we updated all the tooling and added DeFi, and at the end felt it was not as accessible as we would have liked. We also took Juicebox forked it and launched it on Polygon (where Matic is used), which was more what we were looking for.  However, we are not the kind of cats to fork and do stuff, its open source and its fair game, but we contribute, add value and divide up the work, so it seemed right to contribute to helping through v2.  </p><p>One place it was mentioned where we could help was figure out the BannyVerse situation. I pinged Wagmi’s Mieos and started collaborating with constructing Banny to be mintable, worked on the TokenUriResolver how the veBannys were going to be selected, and planning on the BannyVerse would unfold NFT-wise. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thats-fascinating-you-seem-to-be-well-versed-on-the-technical-side-of-this-stuff-in-your-opinion-how-do-daos-protect-themselves-from-bad-actorssabotage"><strong>That’s fascinating, you seem to be well-versed on the technical side of this stuff.

This can be provided to a law firm, also called service provider, or retained by the founders until they revoke the right on chain at a later date. In other words, it’s designed to ensure nothing crazy happens.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="interesting-it-seems-like-that-mechanism-kind-of-runs-against-the-philosophy-of-what-a-dao-is-doesnt-it-how-do-you-strike-a-balance-between-control-and-decentralization">Interesting.

This whole space is a one large expensive experiment and so you really don’t know what may happen, so its safe to be prudent.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-always-think-of-daocrypto-time-similar-to-dog-years-and-aging-like-one-month-of-time-in-a-dao-has-gotta-be-at-least-6-months-or-a-year-at-a-regular-irl-company-you-and-i-of-course-both-help-as-contributors-to-wagmi-productions-how-would-you-describe-your-role-at-jb-and-wagmi-after-this-first-6-weeks-or-so">I always think of DAO/Crypto time similar to dog-years and aging: like one month of time in a DAO has gotta be at least 6 months or a year at a regular IRL company.

I wrote the Juicebox TokenURI Resolver for the veBanny and make sure the composite Banny and appropriate metadata are deployed on IPFS. Additionally and more importantly, when Juicebox token holders go to stake their Banny and enter the Bannyverse, I aim to enable the experience to mint a unique Banny with anything from Hattori Hanzo to AK-47. A banana has got to defend himself. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-always-ask-about-where-all-the-assholes-are-it-seems-like-so-many-talented-people-working-together-should-bring-a-clash-of-egos-where-are-the-assholes"><strong>I always ask about where all the assholes are, it seems like so many talented people working together should bring a clash of egos.

I also think people who stick around are very talented, the Notion docs do a pretty good job about making it clear that you have to contribute before seeking a one-time or reoccurring payout.  All the contributors are pretty cool about their talent. And that kind of sets the atmosphere.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="between-you-and-me-and-the-rest-of-the-internet-whos-your-favorite-contributor-and-why-is-it-mieos">Between you and me and the rest of the internet, who’s your favorite contributor, and why is it Mieos?<a class="hash-link" href="#between-you-and-me-and-the-rest-of-the-internet-whos-your-favorite-contributor-and-why-is-it-mieos" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>I think WAGMI makes it clear you can add a lot of value even if it’s not code. WAGMI’s pixel ninjas, 60 Minutes style interviews, and the enabling of the BannyVerse reinforces that throughout whatever the problem, we are all here to have fun; and reminds us all to no take yourself too seriously, and that says a lot. Mieos is very humble, even though he’s been around in the space for a long time and basically the OG JB whale. He’s pretty rad.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-a-project-within-or-outside-of-jb-that-youre-really-looking-forward-to-in-the-future">What’s a project (within or outside of JB) that you’re really looking forward to in the future?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-a-project-within-or-outside-of-jb-that-youre-really-looking-forward-to-in-the-future" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>MovementDAO, and the future of Juicebox v2 are both things that I am working on and that I am looking forward to enabling. We are all learning every day how things work and willing to change it up, but I want to understand some fundamental parts of what makes Juicebox successful not for just raising funds but to getting people to operate treasuries transparently. We (both JB v2 and MovementDAO) want to enable this with endowments, NFT businesses, start-ups, liquidity pools into a well orchestrated decentralized protocol. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-something-people-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you">What’s something people would be surprised to learn about you?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-something-people-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>I don’t know, hmm… I lived in a monastery!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>标签：</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zh/blog/tags/dao">dao</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zh/blog/tags/interview">interview</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="博文列表分页导航"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/zh/blog/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">较新的博文</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/zh/blog/page/4"><div class="pagination-nav__label">较旧的博文</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div></div>
