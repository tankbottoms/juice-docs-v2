href="#predictions-of-past-and-present" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>Once in a while it may be nice to let loose with a little silliness. So enjoy this short article on 18th century critical theory and the folly of technological prophesies.</p><p>Historicism, that nebulous academic term that finds itself increasingly harder to define the more you delve into it, is at play more than you may think in the ever-changing landscape of web3. A term originally coined by Friedrich Schlegel a couple centuries ago, we will define it– for the purposes of this article– simply as the idea that societies at different times in history can oftentimes lose sight of the fact that time keeps marching forward. The future, it turns out, isn’t the easiest thing to predict. And the present doesn’t offer up all the answers. As much as we may be tempted to feel like we’ve got it all figured out, history has a bad habit of revealing the folly that belies this hubris.</p><p>After all, two Romans speaking a couple thousand years ago didn’t ask each other what year it was, only for one to tell the other, “We’re in the year -22 BCE, dummy!”</p><p>All this a long-winded way to say: people tend to lose sight of the future, or, to be more precise, never truly have it. Our ability to predict is pathetically unreliable as systems grow more complex. Case in point: computing power has grown exponentially, and yet we are still terrible at predicting weather. You’d think with all our developments we’d be able to see a massive hurricane before it forms, and yet this feat is presently considered functionally impossible.</p><p>For all the naysayers out there: criticism of new ideas, technologies and ways of building isn’t too new after all. People have a hard time predicting what will work, but hindsight is 20/20. Enjoy as we pit historical figures, living and otherwise, in a match of predictions in the Premonition Rumble!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="jbs-inaugural-premonition-rumble">JB’s Inaugural Premonition Rumble!<a class="hash-link" href="#jbs-inaugural-premonition-rumble" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="warren-buffet-versus-robert-metcalfe">Warren Buffet versus Robert Metcalfe<a class="hash-link" href="#warren-buffet-versus-robert-metcalfe" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>&quot;In terms of cryptocurrencies generally, I can say almost with certainty that they will come to a bad ending.” - Warren Buffet, 2019</p><p><em>vs</em></p><p>“I predict the Internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse.” — Robert Metcalfe, founder of 3Com, inventor of Ethernet, 1995</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="paul-krugman-versus-thomas-edison">Paul Krugman versus Thomas Edison<a class="hash-link" href="#paul-krugman-versus-thomas-edison" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>“Twelve years on, cryptocurrencies play almost no role in normal economic activity.

Did you and jango have a clear vision for what all that work was going to amount to?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-kept-you-going-early-on-when-you-had-to-move-mountains-and-put-so-much-effort-in-did-you-and-jango-have-a-clear-vision-for-what-all-that-work-was-going-to-amount-to" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>I think jango and I each had our own unique visions for JB– they weren’t opposed in any ways, but there were definitely certain things that were driving me and important to me, and certain things important to him. Early on– really really early on– I didn’t have a complete vision for how JB would exist in the world; it was more just an interesting experiment to build a web-3 app, and I wanted to get some experience working in web-3. JB is fairly complicated, so over the months we were constantly reshaping it, so the vision was changing as well. About 2-3 months before we launched I started to think about it and realized how valuable it would be to DAOs. While we were building it, DAO’s were only just starting to become big. I felt like, somebody could use this not just as a business or to create a fundraiser, but can create a community of people, and that’s when I felt like JB really came into its own and found itself. The beauty of jb is that it’s super extensive, and can be used for all kind of things, not just DAOs.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-the-average-day-for-you-look-like-now-that-jb-has-kind-of-found-its-stride-and-that-major-early-work-has-been-done">What’s the average day for you look like now that JB has kind of found its stride and that major early work has been done?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-the-average-day-for-you-look-like-now-that-jb-has-kind-of-found-its-stride-and-that-major-early-work-has-been-done" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>It’s definitely changed a bit– in the early days after the launch, once JB went public, it didn’t change a lot, but we were also getting a lot of feedback from people on what was needed and how to better streamline things. Putting a lot of these complex items into a digestible way was very hard, especially when you’re so intimately familiar with these complex processes, so getting feedback from people who were seeing this for the first time was a huge help for us.</p><p>Once there were more full-time contributors coming in (who we formed peel with), it changed a lot. I can’t say enough good things about those early contributors– I feel so blessed that they came so eager and willing to put themselves into the work. From day 1 I was pushing code to fix small bugs and also thinking of these big-picture things, so I had wanted for a while a team to be able to help out with some of that workload. It was really beautiful because it was a time of wondering how to get those people in here, and I wondered: is this what a recruiting process looks like, do I need to be advertising positions, interviewing people and so on? That whole process is not something I was very excited or eager about, so I was just like, “Hopefully there will be people who find the project interesting and show up to help out”– and that ended up being exactly what happened! JohnnyD, Aeolian, Torvusbug, Ooyoo were some of the major early contributors and with them we kicked into high gear. The code base got cleaned up a lot and having that diversity of opinion and diversity of experience was just a huge asset. After a month or so of that we realized we had a real team here, and started feeling like a machine.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="with-growth-happening-so-fast-is-there-any-way-to-even-predict-what-jb-might-look-like-in-a-couple-years">With growth happening so fast, is there any way to even predict what JB might look like in a couple years?<a class="hash-link" href="#with-growth-happening-so-fast-is-there-any-way-to-even-predict-what-jb-might-look-like-in-a-couple-years" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>The speed of things is remarkable, and that’s an amazing attribute of web 3. JB feels like it’s going as fast as it can go, and that’s a consequence of a  number of things. A big factor is that there’s always public conversations and transparency, so there’s very little time wasted on catching people up, so everyone is getting the info more or less in real-time at the same time. Most people spending time on this aren’t clocking out at 5pm, they’re working when they want to and when they feel like it, and their passion has them executing ideas very quickly, which is wild.</p><p>Talking about 2 years from now, that feels like a lifetime; it’s hard to make any predictions, but I think the main thing we’ll see going forward that I can hardly even really predict– I don’t know what it’ll look like– but I think there’ll be a lot more decentralization of the project itself. With introduction of V2 there’s gonna be a lot of added flexibility, with more diverse use cases people can use JB for, and a lot of these use cases will probably end up being built around custom extensions of JB.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="switching-gears-a-bit-when-you-meet-that-awkward-uncle-at-thanksgiving-we-all-have-and-they-ask-you-what-you-do-how-do-you-explain-jb-and-your-role-in-it">Switching gears a bit: when you meet that awkward uncle at thanksgiving we all have, and they ask you what you do, how do you explain JB and your role in it?<a class="hash-link" href="#switching-gears-a-bit-when-you-meet-that-awkward-uncle-at-thanksgiving-we-all-have-and-they-ask-you-what-you-do-how-do-you-explain-jb-and-your-role-in-it" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Haha. To be honest I don’t find myself in that situation all that often, so I don’t practice very frequently, and every time I do find myself in that situation my take on it may have changed since the last time. Oftentimes, if it’s someone who isn’t familiar with web 3, I won’t even mention JB at all because there’s so many layers of abstraction to go through. But if someone’s really curious, I generally start by comparing it kickstarter, and I don’t really think that’s the best place to start, it’s just the easiest since it’s a fairly similar type of mechanism people are already familiar with. So you can kinda start there as an organization that raises money, but obviously the big differences you have to jump to is issuance of tokens, what that means, the programmability of it all, the restriction on money withdrawal and to whom. That’s when it starts getting really tricky to explain.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="im-always-surprised-by-the-conspicuous-lack-of-assholes-at-jb-where-are-they-all-hiding">I’m always surprised by the conspicuous lack of assholes at JB– where are they all hiding?<a class="hash-link" href="#im-always-surprised-by-the-conspicuous-lack-of-assholes-at-jb-where-are-they-all-hiding" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Haha. I really have never thought about that. There’s a lot of assholes in the world, and maybe there were 2-3 who have come through JB in the past, but I think of it by remembering this term jango said to me once, he used this expression– “DAO immune system”-- and it immediately clicked to me what he meant: every DAO that has a strong culture, they have an immune system, and it’s an immune system to people and decisions. And the consequence of that is if there’s ideas thrown out and talked about that aren’t fitting with the momentum of the DAO, then it tends to be squashed. But the beautiful thing about that is that the way the JB immune system seems to work is very polite and genuine.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="would-you-call-that-killing-with-kindness">Would you call that killing with kindness?<a class="hash-link" href="#would-you-call-that-killing-with-kindness" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Yeah, I definitely see a lot of that, and it’s a beautiful thing. On the topic of the DAO immune system, when factions do emerge, the beautiful thing about it is that it still remains a very democratic process, and evaluations of decisions aren&#x27;t based on what’s “right” and “wrong”, it’s rather the democratic process of voting with JBX. Also fascinating: they’ve always been fairly close votes when these issues have arisen. Ideally the way the system is set up and the governance processes we have, the DAO will ultimately decide what’s best one way or another, and that’s entirely subjective, since there’s no such thing as an objectively good or bad outcome.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="its-interesting-connecting-daos-to-democracy-in-democracy-we-have-structures-to-influence-voting-like-campaigning-super-pacs-etc-arguably-the-world-of-daos-is-too-young-for-this-but-do-you-see-this-is-an-eventuality-of-communities-and-factions-within-daos-trying-to-gain-control-to-guide-dao-decision-making">It’s interesting connecting DAO’s to democracy– in democracy, we have structures to influence voting, like campaigning, super PACS, etc. Arguably the world of DAOs is too young for this– but do you see this is an eventuality of communities and factions within DAOs trying to gain control to guide DAO decision-making?<a class="hash-link" href="#its-interesting-connecting-daos-to-democracy-in-democracy-we-have-structures-to-influence-voting-like-campaigning-super-pacs-etc-arguably-the-world-of-daos-is-too-young-for-this-but-do-you-see-this-is-an-eventuality-of-communities-and-factions-within-daos-trying-to-gain-control-to-guide-dao-decision-making" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>I think we see that already. That’s a necessary part of any voting process, a “campaign”-- it doesn’t necessarily need to look like what we think of campaigns in ordinary politics (posters, pamphlets, etc) but it already does happen, for instance when somebody creates a proposal, there’s an implicit requisite for them to defend that proposal and explain why. The temperature check is designed for discourse, and those types of conversations are themselves a form of campaigning. It’s the responsibility of people much more involved in JB who have a more nuanced understanding of the mechanisms to distill their opinions on responsible voting, or to fairly summarize the pros and cons of the proposal because less-active JB members aren’t as familiar with the proposal.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="excellent-point-switching-gears-who-is-your-favorite-jb-contributor-and-why-is-it-filipv">Excellent point. Switching gears: who is your favorite JB contributor, and why is it filipv?<a class="hash-link" href="#excellent-point-switching-gears-who-is-your-favorite-jb-contributor-and-why-is-it-filipv" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Haha. Filip’s great, I have a lot of love for filip. When I think of filip, the things that come to mind are that he’s just an excellent talker, and being a good talker is not something that feels like a resume item, but it really is, it’s a really truly valuable skill that’s underrated. Having somebody like filip facilitate conversations like he does is super valuable. Not only is he so good at explaining things, he’s also very open-minded, knowledgeable of what he knows and quick not to pretend he’s knowledgeable about what he doesn’t know. He’s very active, and good about proposing things we may not be thinking about. The dude just seems very level-headed; I love talking to him.</p><p>If I had to pick a favorite that wasn’t filipv– I mean you can’t pick just one obviously– but the other person I really respect is aeolian, who has come in and really taken over a lot from me to be the lead front-end person on peel. And I just have so much mad respect for aeolian– not only is he a great developer, but he knows his stuff and is great at writing good code, and he’s great at having conversations about these things and being open to learn, open minded, open to teach. All the times I spent working with him– I really credit a lot of the joy I get contributing to peel, to him and the rest of the peel team, because he’s made work so enjoyable.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thats-awesome-okay-final-question-do-you-have-any-huge-project-in-the-future-youre-particularly-excited-about">That’s awesome. Okay, final question: do you have any huge project in the future you’re particularly excited about?<a class="hash-link" href="#thats-awesome-okay-final-question-do-you-have-any-huge-project-in-the-future-youre-particularly-excited-about" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>That’s hard to say. At the moment, as of about a week ago, I’m spending much less time at JB. I’ve contributed to JB for so long, and having a solid group of contributors like the peel team to help take on my workload has eased me up to pursue new projects. I’ve wanted to do some different type of work that is’t necessarily front-end code, like some solidity work, and art-projects, and so on. So I do have a lot more time to spend on other projects now, and there’s another project that I’m working on now– that hasn’t really been announced yet– but I’m looking forward to announcing it soon.</p><p>(Note: this interview was transcribed from a discord call.)</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>标签：</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zh/blog/tags/dao">dao</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zh/blog/tags/interview">interview</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/zh/blog/juicebox-in-the-words-of-jango">Juicebox in the Words of jango</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-04-04T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">2022年4月4日</time> · <!-- -->9 分钟阅读</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/realfelixander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1509677708854239233/Bsru0Xks_400x400.jpg" alt="Felixander"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/realfelixander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Felixander</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Community Member</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>“Juicebox in the words of” is a series that highlights JB community members in interview form.

Around 2014/2015ish, I was building this app in iOS dev world. That was back in my younger days when I loved building shit, working with friends, piecing together who’s good at what, etc. We didn’t have a tonne of users on the app, but we had an open slack server where several users would come hang out with the builders</p><p>We didn’t want to think about price, business models, advertising etc. We just wanted to build, and we didn’t like thinking of this structure with users on one side to pay fees, and builders on the other to create and get paid, since we felt like the folks using the app were a part of the building process as well.</p><p>One day I was sitting with my notebook, trying to figure out how this whole thing was going to play out, and I captured an idea floating by. If we figured out exactly how much it would cost to run this thing, including server hosting, salaries, and so on, we could come up with one number we needed to get to by the end of the month. When we realized we could enumerate exactly what those expenses were to the users, fully transparently, and tell them listen, this is what we need to get to each month for the service to run, and if we exceed this number, we’re going to use that overflow to push down the price of the product– once we realized that, we just ran with the idea and that became the product. It seems like a win-win– the team gets paid, the users get a service, and if it becomes more successful, the service becomes more and more affordable, or even free.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="that-sounds-like-a-light-bulb-moment-how-did-it-translate-into-your-project-at-that-time">That sounds like a light-bulb moment. How did it translate into your project at that time?<a class="hash-link" href="#that-sounds-like-a-light-bulb-moment-how-did-it-translate-into-your-project-at-that-time" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>So I stopped the project to focus full time on the building out this new concept, but tried to do it all in the Web 2 world, and it was really really hard– trying to forge relationships with banking systems about a system where there’s fees, maybe fee refunds if we have overflow, etc., and someone would have coordinate all these fees, refunds, and so on, it just wasn’t possible to manage all that with Web 2 structures. Around that same time I was delving into crypto, learning about the blockchain, smart contracts, and then in hit me: this idea was executable, but we were totally swimming against the current trying to do it in the Web 2 space. So I hunkered down and jumped into learning everything I could about smart contracts, did some prototypes, and by that time a lot of the team was like man, I can’t get dragged on another project, so I decided to kind of jump in head-first and take the lead on seeing how this would play out. I figured the moment we had something tangible, all these brilliant people who I’d met and who I had the luxury to spend time with would just hop on and help give it life.</p><p>At this point I was working hard along with peri to get this concept built out, and we actually went a few different iterations of the name. There was “the sustainers market”, back in the Web 2 world, and then eventually we called it “fountain”, because of how overflow from payments kind of would trickle down, and then at a certain point, I think it was peri who said, let’s just call it “milk”, and we got real funky with it and said fine, and so it was “milk” for about five minutes, and then we decided on “juice,” and that actually stuck for a while. It wasn’t until like a week before launch that we felt like man, something’s missing, and then somehow we came up with “Juicebox,” and we all felt immediately like yes, that’s the one, and so we launched with that.</p><p>In terms of where JB is today: everyday it changes a little bit, and early on we had no idea how it would be used. I had a decent understanding of how I may use it, but seeing how it’s been used has been really awesome. But who the hell knows where it’s going. We learned so much along the way, and a lot of incredible badass motherfuckers started to come through and add on to it, and it’s only gotten better and better because of that.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="peri-told-me-about-the-dao-immune-system---a-term-you-coined---can-you-explain-it-in-a-bit-more-detail">peri told me about the “DAO immune system” - a term you coined - can you explain it in a bit more detail?<a class="hash-link" href="#peri-told-me-about-the-dao-immune-system---a-term-you-coined---can-you-explain-it-in-a-bit-more-detail" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>I remember that! That’s a fascinating concept. People are diverse, and JB has always had an amazing team, but over the span since launch there have been some ideas that have come up and vouched for adoption or funding, or were communicated in non-productive ways, and other folks started running away from these or critiquing them heavily, the same way a body would reject a pathogen. I found that so fascinating, and wondered how that worked, since it seemed to happen all on its own.</p><p>The DAO is interesting, in that I see it more as a place where ideas exist and sometimes compete. I don’t think people are bad for DAOs, but ideas can certainly take root and harm the operation of a DAO. The interesting thing is early on in a DAO, ideas that come up for vote are not only important short-term, but also precedent-setting. This is a double-edged sword though, because while setting precedent can kind of immunize a DAO against future bad ideas, it can also lead a DAO to try to solve new problems with old methods. All of this is still in a nascent stage, and very fragile, so it’s interesting to see how it plays out, but I do think a DAO has some built-in mechanisms, certainly JB does, that kind of helps it move in positive, productive directions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="speaking-of-how-fragile-all-this-is-how-do-you-approach-managing-risk">Speaking of how fragile all this is, how do you approach managing risk?<a class="hash-link" href="#speaking-of-how-fragile-all-this-is-how-do-you-approach-managing-risk" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>A lot of the things I learned come from taking risk, and I’m not a risk averse person. In this context specifically, maybe as a programmer of the contracts you tend to feel a bit more of that weight, and you can sense a community in anticipation, and a zealousness, and so just peeling toward balance in general I think is healthy. More generally, and this is something I constantly point out, is that we need to keep the focus– it’s tempting to go to the next thing prematurely– but we need to keep the focus and stay the course on the tasks in the here and now.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="jb-seems-so-inclusive-and-friendly-so-im-wondering-where-are-all-the-assholes">JB seems so inclusive and friendly, so I’m wondering: where are all the assholes?<a class="hash-link" href="#jb-seems-so-inclusive-and-friendly-so-im-wondering-where-are-all-the-assholes" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>I’m kind of a proponent of assholery, if it’s needed. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-wait-jb-doesnt-need-it-now-did-it-ever">So wait, JB doesn’t need it now? Did it ever?<a class="hash-link" href="#so-wait-jb-doesnt-need-it-now-did-it-ever" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>At JB, we’re doing a thing and everyone has a mode of operation– when you talk about inclusivity, it’s not saying that anything goes. After all a lot of people are taking a lot of risk here, and we can’t be inclusive of things like cutting corners or taking simple approaches that don’t match the complexity of a problem. I don’t think being an asshole is good, obviously, but sometimes you do need to focus in the conversation, and there will always be some people who don’t want to do that, but I think that’s where the limit is to the inclusivity. So I don’t think there’s assholes around, but if we needed them to keep us honest, or if a situation requires people to act that way to make real progress, then maybe we’d see more of them. Fortunately at JB we’re a good team and we communicate well, the transparency is there, but if that wasn’t the case then I don’t know that assholes would be a bad thing.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="who-is-your-favorite-jb-contributor-and-why-is-it-zeugh">Who is your favorite JB contributor, and why is it Zeugh?<a class="hash-link" href="#who-is-your-favorite-jb-contributor-and-why-is-it-zeugh" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Zeugh is a complex, charming character. I’m a sucker for really complex, charming characters. I don’t care for yea-sayers or nay-sayers, and people like Zeugh are their own person. Love him for it.</p><p>Without question peri is my favorite for many reasons, Zeugh for many reasons, Mieos for many reasons. Twodam is a fucking legend, he’s subtle and sometimes goes unnoticed but holy moly, anytime I talk to anyone about some of our contributors twodam comes up and oh my goodness, what an incredible incredible person.
Not a fair question.</p><p>Folks who have a strong belief or mindset or some part about them that isn’t looking to step aside (or who just want to be there by association), but rather people who want to be there because of who they are, that tends to be the ones that stick out to me. People who, given a good enough idea, argument or situation, will 100% get behind something and contribute to its success, even if they at first have a hard time with it, are the kinds of people that stick out to me. It’s not stubbornness per se; it’s productive arguments and debates and vibes and fun.</p><p>Oh man… It’s impossible to pick a favorite, but that characteristic of people is definitely important to me.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="excellent-answer-okay-final-question-whats-something-people-would-be-surprised-to-learn-about-you">Excellent answer.

That’s led to a few things– one is that the culture has evolved, it’s gotten a bit more serious and formal, but we’ve also had a really large demographic shift as the Chinese community has taken greater interest in JB. The team has grown, and I feel like we’ve moved into a higher gear work-wise, and become more efficient as a team.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-would-you-describe-your-role-at-jb">How would you describe your role at JB?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-would-you-describe-your-role-at-jb" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>If I had to put a title, I guess “operations”, or “operations generalist”.

Also I think JB attracts a different type of person– there’s no job interview, manager telling you what to do, etc.-- you really have to be a self-starter, and since everything is handled by voting by your peers, there’s real incentives for you to get along; if you’re an asshole, people will vote you out.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-something-that-people-would-be-surprised-to-find-out-about-you">What’s something that people would be surprised to find out about you?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-something-that-people-would-be-surprised-to-find-out-about-you" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Hmm.

I initially started quietly lurking in JB honestly because I know and admire the team who created it.  I have zero technical background so as you can probably imagine...I had no clue what any of them were talking about.  I can&#x27;t remember exactly when I joined, but probably around October &#x27;21.  The discord was still pretty small, I think we there were max 5-6 people on town hall calls so it was very close knit but very welcoming to normies like myself (which to be honest, it&#x27;s still a pretty tight group of contributors who are also still very welcoming imo even though the membership has grown quite a lot)!  I started slowly but surely participating, asking questions (even &quot;dumb&quot; ones),  then ultimately took on a pm role to help keep people moving in a forward direction and tasks from slipping through cracks.  Since I joined, JB has definitely matured.  Processes have been dialed in, incredible work teams have come together, grown and transitioned into their own DOAs  (amazing!), and the synergy in how, so many people, from all over the world is nothing less than awe inspiring! </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="that-is-some-awesome-background-really-interesting-stuff-it-sounds-like-you-have-a-pretty-wide-perspective-having-been-here-so-long-compared-to-many-so-for-your-role-here-how-would-you-call-yourself-it-sounds-like-youre-kind-of-a-fixer-somebody-who-comes-and-makes-things-run-smoothly-patches-up-cracks-that-arise-etc">That is some awesome background, really interesting stuff. It sounds like you have a pretty wide perspective, having been here so long compared to many. So for your role here, how would you call yourself? It sounds like you&#x27;re kind of a fixer, somebody who comes and makes things run smoothly, patches up cracks that arise, etc.<a class="hash-link" href="#that-is-some-awesome-background-really-interesting-stuff-it-sounds-like-you-have-a-pretty-wide-perspective-having-been-here-so-long-compared-to-many-so-for-your-role-here-how-would-you-call-yourself-it-sounds-like-youre-kind-of-a-fixer-somebody-who-comes-and-makes-things-run-smoothly-patches-up-cracks-that-arise-etc" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>So, I like that observation- but certainly not a fixer technically speaking-I guess more along the lines if something isn&#x27;t getting done, I give soft nudges for reminders.  I also like to think I&#x27;m a connector.  If new folks come in, looking for something in particular, whether an answer to a protocol question or how to get started with picking up tasks, I do a decent job pointing them in the right direction, then following up when necessary.  I&#x27;m like one of those old phone operators...just connecting dots! </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="between-you-and-me-and-the-rest-of-the-internet-who-is-your-favorite-contributor-and-why-is-it-jango">Between you and me and the rest of the internet, who is your favorite contributor, and why is it jango?<a class="hash-link" href="#between-you-and-me-and-the-rest-of-the-internet-who-is-your-favorite-contributor-and-why-is-it-jango" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>favorite contributor...hard question. I&#x27;m going with the pc answer here: they&#x27;re all freaking rad humans! There&#x27;s no way I can pick just one.

It feels special in a way that none of the other projects to date have.  They&#x27;re really trying to find ways to create &quot;movements&quot; to make the world a better place without it feeling hokey or like a canned answer in a beauty pageant (are they even called that anymore- don&#x27;t get me cancelled!).  One thing I heard in a recent town hall was &quot;community can solve our biggest problems&quot; and that stuck with me!  IMO, they&#x27;re doin&#x27; it right! go check &#x27;em out! </p><p>As far as a moment of great excitement at JB would have to include when constitution DAO popped off...that. was. wild.   I believe it was around Thanksgiving- I went to bed knowing one, peaceful, calm version up JB and woke up to a whirlwind of new members, wen moon, and tons of questions!  Zeugh and Nicolas took the brunt of that, definitely get their versions-great stories- but man, it was intense!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sounds-intense-ive-been-taken-aback-at-how-approachable-and-nice-and-inclusive-people-have-been-here-at-jb-so-im-wondering-where-are-all-the-assholes">Sounds intense!

I&#x27;m actually trying to answer that for myself.  I want to figure out a way to gamify wellness that&#x27;s enjoyable and doesn&#x27;t feel like a task. Wellbeing is so so crucial but is so easily ignored because most people just don&#x27;t know what they don&#x27;t know (ie: don&#x27;t realized they can feel better physically and mentally). What that looks like exactly...stay tuned.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>标签：</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zh/blog/tags/dao">dao</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zh/blog/tags/interview">interview</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/zh/blog/unbridled-creativity">Unbridled Creativity: The DAO experience through the lens of Cryptovoxels</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-03-25T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">2022年3月25日</time> · <!-- -->3 分钟阅读</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/realfelixander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1509677708854239233/Bsru0Xks_400x400.jpg" alt="Felixander"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/realfelixander" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Felixander</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Community Member</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><img loading="lazy" src="/zh/assets/images/image-fae86f5a3ab9bc0e2bbadd3e7bf1b988.png" width="1012" height="786" class="img_ev3q">The Cryptovoxels environment from above</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-new-way-to-wind-down">A new way to wind down<a class="hash-link" href="#a-new-way-to-wind-down" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>The DAO space online isn’t like your average experience working at a company or corporation. Unlike the physical environment of offices, cubicles, and maybe the occasional beanbag chair if you happen to work at one of those <em>fun</em> places, the online space where DAOs operate is free from constraints and incentives. It’s a space where people create for the sake of it, and pool effort together as a means of expression. Don’t get me wrong, there are plenty of endeavors out there that seek to make money, but the crucial difference is about what we call the bottom line, and what it looks like in a DAO space versus traditional settings.</p><p>Enter Cryptovoxels: an online space where participants can congregate, listen to music together, and even enjoy a “live” show in a virtual environment (pictured above). The Cryptovoxels space isn’t unique for what it is— plenty of paid spaces exist that try to achieve the same goal. The reason Cryptovoxels is unique is precisely for what it isn’t. It’s not about raising money, or pandering to users for shares and likes and what have you. It’s a space to wind down and enjoy together in a uniquely anti-consumerist experience. A space where creatives, programmers, technical writers, holders and any and all between can congregate for the sake of it.

In a traditional work environment or major corporation, somebody at the top may have an idea to create a space such as Cryptovoxels. From there, the idea would distill as it trickled down the workforce, ultimately culminating in strict directives and program managers. In other words, the project would itself become work— anathema to its very purpose!</p><p>In the DAOsphere, the whole process is put on its head. Eager community members, excited to contribute to a greater organization, and at times simply wanting to spin their wheels, generate projects such as Cryptovoxels not in order to make money, not in order to boast, not in order to monetize an experience, but, rather, simply to enjoy a moment— a happening, a vibe— with one another in a shared space. Where else can we say that this is the case?

They’re spaces that uniquely represent a way of thinking about the world and its members differently than before.

The irony that the same Web 3.0 that brought us NFTs of just about everything can also bring us closer together in a completely non-exploitative way is rich, to be sure.

Juicebox has become a platform to support a thriving ecosystem of DAOs, who are all at different points in their development. It can be tough to stand out through the noise and develop a key marketing strategy for your project or DAO. Starting a successful web3 project is hard work with most projects on JuiceBox failing to attract more than 1 ETH in contributions.</p><p>Here are 3 tips for giving investors confidence and encouraging ETH contributions for you DAO, that I’ve learned from my time assisting at SharkDao.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="have-reputable-signers-for-the-multisig-and-a-plan-for-how-those-funds-are-released">Have reputable signers for the multisig and a plan for how those funds are released.<a class="hash-link" href="#have-reputable-signers-for-the-multisig-and-a-plan-for-how-those-funds-are-released" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>One of the first questions I ask when analyzing DAOs is “how are the funds secured?” If you’ve been paying attention to DeFi news recently you’ll have heard of the Wonderland fiasco, where one member with a shady history was allowed to manage the treasury of the DAO. This has not bode well for $TIME price action and the Wonderland community. Having reputable signers to properly store and distribute finds is crucial to the success of a DAO, no matter how big the treasury is.</p><p>The most common way to secure funds is to have multiple signers on Gnosis safe (more info here) to ensure that not any single person can rug the project. Many DAOs I’ve seen get past the first step of having a gnosis safe in the first place instead of just one wallet, but then fail the second part of security which is having reputable signers.</p><p>Having singers that check off at least some of these boxes can be a big confidence boost for potential members looking to invest into your project.</p><ol><li>A signer with an established presence on twitter</li><li>A signer involved in multiple projects throughout the crypto space</li><li>A signer who is doxxed and is reputable outside of the metaverse</li><li>A member of the Juicebox team</li><li>A member of a different prominent DAO or multisig signer.</li><li>A paid reputable neutral party to assist with signing (crypto funds, institutions, etc.)</li></ol><p>Ask around on discord and twitter, and you may be pleasantly surprised by the generosity of the web3 community to assist in your DAO, and maybe even make a friend or two.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="have-a-tokenomics-and-governance-strategy">Have a tokenomics and governance strategy<a class="hash-link" href="#have-a-tokenomics-and-governance-strategy" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>If people are going to be contributing to your project, it helps to let potential new members know what exactly they are buying into. Slush funds, for vague and unspecified purposes are a red flag for potential rug pulls or honeypots on Juicebox.</p><p>Before starting a project on Juicebox, it’s best to clarify to potential new members: what is the purpose of your projects coin?</p><p>When someone contributes to your project, what does the token they get in return represent? Natively, Juicebox allows projects to enable token holders make a claim on a projects treasury, but beyond that token utility is only bound by social or legal agreements.</p><p>Some ideas to add utility:</p><ol><li>Governance rights. Each token represents a single vote in off chain voting tools like Snapshot.</li><li>Token gating. Requiring either one or multiple tokens to enter select or all discord sever channels.</li><li>Claim on treasury. Juicebox allows projects to let token holders make a claim on a projects treasury, and burn coins for eth.</li><li>Mint pass. Holding tokens allows you an ability to mint free or paid NFTs.</li></ol><p>Experiment, stand out, think of new and novel ideas for both your governance and tokenomics, and you’ll be far more likely to and attract attention to your project.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="have-a-friendly-and-inviting-discord-fun-and-exciting-twitter-and-a-thorough-faq-that-is-updated-regularly">Have a friendly and inviting discord, fun and exciting twitter, and a thorough FAQ that is updated regularly.<a class="hash-link" href="#have-a-friendly-and-inviting-discord-fun-and-exciting-twitter-and-a-thorough-faq-that-is-updated-regularly" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>The first two touch points people are likely to have with your project are going to be your Twitter and Discord. Twitter and Discord have become the two go-to platforms for web3 communities, and are a tried and true recipe for success. Most web3 projects don’t ever launch to platforms like Instagram and Tiktok and still remain highly competitive. While other social media platforms may be helpful for your project, it’s best to stick to only twitter and discord, especially if you’re stretched for time and talent. If you market your twitter+discord well, it is far more effective than half a dozen social media platforms marketed mediocrely.</p><p>Successful web3 projects are able to leverage their twitter to attract high quality community members, who often become key contributors. Potential members will find your discord and evaluate the strength of your project, often based on aesthetic values at a first glance. Here’s a checklist to help you make sure your socials are well maintained</p><p>Twitter:</p><ol><li>Push twitter updates regularly. Daily is best, but at a bare minimum twice a week, or your project will start to appear absent and unmanaged.</li><li>Reply and engage with other twitter accounts, don’t only push status updates.</li><li>Have an engaging pinned tweet, and aesthetically pleasing profile picture+banner. First impressions are important.</li><li>Offer giveaways and contests to encourage engagement (don’t overdo it!).</li></ol><p>When starting a discord, it’s important that there’s someone to greet new members, be friendly, and answer questions. This person of contact is often called a community manager (CM). In larger projects, there’s often a dedicated CM to do this job, but in smaller projects this job usually falls to someone on the founding team. Regardless of who is assigned to these tasks, it’s important that there always be someone answering questions and directing people to proper resources in a reasonable amount of time.  Here are some tips to make a community managing less stressful, and more engaging for members.</p><p>Discord:</p><ol><li>Keep channels to a minimum when possible.</li><li>Clear and concise channel names and descriptions.</li><li>Create an FAQ + resource guide and update it regularly. If a question is asked twice, it’s a frequently asked question. Chances are it will be asked a third time.</li><li>Offer a fun and engaging role system for your discord. Some ideas: react roles where people can self assign, being helpful gets its own role, donators/investors get their own role.</li><li>Same as twitter, offer giveaways and contests to encourage engagement (again, don’t overdo it!)</li></ol><p>Put time, love, and energy into your socials and you’ll attract both capital and talent to your project.</p><p>-Synth</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>标签：</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zh/blog/tags/guide">guide</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="博文列表分页导航"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/zh/blog/page/3"><div class="pagination-nav__label">较新的博文</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/zh/blog/page/5"><div class="pagination-nav__label">较旧的博文</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div></div>
