itemprop="articleBody"><p>Do you want to know the surefire way to build a DAO with a small, strong community? It’s easy. Just start with a DAO with a large, strong community!</p><p>Okay, all kidding aside, if you are serious about venturing into the worlds of DAO creation, read on to learn some tips and tricks to ensure that your DAO delivers on its full potential!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="build-a-community">Build a community<a class="hash-link" href="#build-a-community" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Whether your DAO is doing NFT minting, creating tokens for governance, bringing together a global community around a shared goal or interest, or just there to further some unique idea of yours, you’re going to need a community. The problem? Not all communities are created equal, and many of them struggle to find their footing in the hustle and bustle of web3.</p><p>Finding good community members isn’t easy, but keeping them in the long run can be even harder. If your DAO has no way to compensate good community members or suffers from lack of coordinate or mission-alignment issues, you will likely find qualified people sticking around briefly and moving on. Consider thinking carefully about your mission and about a way to make it enthralling for new members. Sell the idea, and show how that idea will benefit your contributors or the planet at large. Don’t be afraid to say no, and have your mission well thought-out before you open a discord and start trying to attract new members.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="decide-on-governance-that-works-now">Decide on governance that works NOW<a class="hash-link" href="#decide-on-governance-that-works-now" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Many different <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/great-web3-governance-at-a-glance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">governance</a> systems exist, including 1-member-1-vote, quadratic voting, voting-by-tokens-held, and many more. Think carefully about how you’d like your own DAO to operate. Do you want everyone to have equal participation and inclusion? Then perhaps one-member-one-vote is the way to go. Or do you want certain members to have voting power because they are part of a core group? Do you want votes to pass with a 51% majority, or higher?</p><p>These are all important questions to consider. If you want a DAO that is more resistant to change, you may consider putting a voting threshold very high, for instance around 75% or above. This would ensure that only when the vast majority of your members agree on something that it will change.</p><p>If you want your DAO to morph quickly with changing times, you may decide to drop your voting threshold lower than 50%. This can also open you open to having your DAO hijacked by an influx of new members, so beware!</p><p>Regarding votes, how do you want people’s voting power to be represented? If you want to vote by tokens-held, then you are effectively allowing the wealthy to have greater voting power than the less wealthy. There is an argument here that the wealthy, who have invested the most in your project, deserve more voting power because they have more to lose. But new members entering your project may feel like voting is futile if they are eclipsed by others with outized voting power.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dont-be-afraid-to-adapt-as-you-scale-up">Don’t be afraid to adapt as you scale up<a class="hash-link" href="#dont-be-afraid-to-adapt-as-you-scale-up" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Consider what system you need right now, and be open to changing it. Regarding governance: If you are a small community with a core team, you may say that one-member-one-vote is the way to go. Do what makes sense at the time. If your project grows and you see another voting mechanism being more fruitful, go through the motions and suggest a change. Voting mechanisms are not set in stone, and shouldn’t be. Your DAO needs to adapt with the changing circumstances it finds itself in.</p><p>Regarding your discord server, Telegram or other service, consider changing it as your needs change. If your discord channels end up getting outdated, don’t be afraid to archive them. If your new members are getting lost in the onboarding process, consider adapting your process to be more open to new faces. Remember that by the time you start to grow, your DAO will be something you start to understand much more easily than a new member just coming in. It’s easy to lose sight of that perspective, so keep in mind to keep it simple and direct.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="and-most-importantly">And most importantly…<a class="hash-link" href="#and-most-importantly" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Have fun! You are engaging in something new, and in a great human experiment! Issues around governance have plagued humanity for thousands of years, and now with the advent of blockchain technology we have yet another style of governance to play with.

For thousands of years civilizations have attempted to crack this pesky conundrum, and arguably we’ve gotten a bit better at it. But has anyone truly solved governance? When we look at the instability in our history, it’s hard to say we have.</p><p>With blockchain and decentralization, a new movement has emerged to try to demonstrate what proper governance can look like. The <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/daolicious-tips-for-starting-your-first-dao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DAO</a>, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is one of many new attempts to organize human beings in a way that is conducive to efficiently and happiness. <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/the-power-of-tokenomics-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tokenomics</a>— a unique staple in web3 organizations— potentially hold the power to reinvent governance as we know it. So what’s the best system?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="community-as-the-core-of-great-governance">Community as the core of great governance<a class="hash-link" href="#community-as-the-core-of-great-governance" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>The short answer is: we don’t know. There are still total intangibles to governance that seem to elude our planning. Let’s take a look at the United States’ governance as an example.</p><p>Many people will point to the United States, a representative democracy, as an example of an effective governance system. Consider, however, that early on in the forming of that government, the first president, George Washington, was given free reign to control the government as he saw fit. He could have declared himself a king, and in fact it was his completely voluntary precedents that determined much of how the government matured in subsequent years.</p><p>Most people would agree that this kind of noble behavior is what shaped the United States toward democracy, and that Washington single-handedly could have given himself supreme power but chose not to. So this begs the question: how do we find the George Washington’s in web3? Where are the builders who will willingly take a back seat to allow an organization to grow?</p><p>And this is where community comes into play. A strong community with shared values and interests is one way to ensure that your members will look out for one another. George Washington has just gone through a war, and was thinking of what great sacrifices took place so that this new government could form. He was surrounded by soldiers and generals and statesmen who had gone through something similar. His incentive was to improve community, not hijack it.</p><p>What does the web3 analogue look like? That’s hard to say. A quick look at some of <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/juicebox-the-token-minting-powerhouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicebox</a>’s governance systems will show why we believe that are some tangibles, however, that can point you in the right direction.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="transparency-is-key">Transparency is key<a class="hash-link" href="#transparency-is-key" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>web3 is paradoxical in more ways than one. Perhaps at its core, however, is the idea that transparency is key. No backdoor deals, and everything can can be audited if one wishes.</p><p>This system dovetails with the themes of trustlessness we see all over blockchain discussions. If I’m regularly doing backroom deals, in the traditional world I would need your trust to let me keep doing that. How do you know I’m not abusing that trust? You don’t. In the web3 world, I have to have my dealings out in the open. Now, I don’t care if you trust me or not, because you can freely look at what I’m doing and, if it’s inappropriate, you can simple call attention to that.</p><p>Does this always work? No, of course not. But does it go a far way to establishing a shared value system? Yes. If everything is open, including payout distributions, proposals for how to change something, or partnership deals, then likely everyone will be on the same page about it. It also gives opportunity for structured disagreements, where hard questions can be asked.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bringing-it-all-together">Bringing it all together<a class="hash-link" href="#bringing-it-all-together" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>If anybody promises you that they have a system for finding the “George Washingtons” in your governance, run the other way. There is no sure-fire way to find the intangibles. What you can do, however, is structure your governance in a way that scares away the bad actors. Remember that your fifth columns only work when there are shadows, concealment, and graft at play. When you shine a bright light on everything, suddenly the environment is less conducive to trickery and value-misalignment (whether pernicious or well-intentioned). Keep that light shining bright, and don’t be afraid to speak your mind. You owe it to yourself and to your governance-compatriots.</p><p>Want more?

I can’t wait to get started on my accounting!” We get it. You have a passion, and it’s probably not in making an accounts payable/receivable department.</p><p>But here’s the thing: how your <a href="https://info.juicebox.money/blog/daolicious-tips-for-starting-your-first-dao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DAO</a>, business or non-profit treats its capital is <em>absolutely</em> an essential factor to its long-term success.

That’s what the Juicebox programmable treasury delivers. It allows you to easily set payouts, determine where new funds go, how they are connected to tokens which, by the way, are also minted at your discretion. It puts all that power in your hands, without asking you to take on another full-time job, or pay out another full-time salary, saving you capital when you need it most.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="keeping-your-passion-where-it-belongs">Keeping your passion where it belongs<a class="hash-link" href="#keeping-your-passion-where-it-belongs" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>The Juicebox programmable treasury comes with a full suite of tooling that is easy to use and implement.

Starting a web3 business and you need to track your accounts payable/receivable? Juicebox can do that. Starting a nonprofit where you want to reward members with tokens for governance and participation? Juicebox can do that, too. Don’t quite know what you want to create, but you know you want a project that executes on-chain and has more tooling than anybody else in the game? Juicebox has you covered.</p><p>There are few web3 platforms out there that can help you create your own project and DAO, but none of them can do it with the ease and tooling that Juicebox can. Juicebox provides users with a platform to raise money, either as a one-time or on a recurring basis, all while also offering a suit of tokenomics tooling and token minting. If you don’t want tokens, no problem, you can use Juicebox like a simple programmable treasury to track donations, payments, profits (or “overflow” as you’ll come to learn), in a transparent and honest way. The days of opaque bookkeeping where contributors have to wonder exactly how their donations are spent are over.</p><p>Juicebox can be the backbone of a local school PTA tracking funds in and out, or it can (and has!) run multi-million dollar operations. It scales effortlessly and gives you tooling to create rich token-based voting economies, as well.</p><p>Perhaps most unique is Juicebox’s approach to what it calls “overflow”, which is money raised above your target amount. This money, which otherwise may be called “profit” and traditionally may go to executive payrolls or reinvestment, sits in a treasury and can be claimed by any holders of your token. The proportional claim of the treasury a token holder receives is completely set by you using a variety of tooling, and it incentivizes anyone participating in your project to want to see its success. It’s a great way to build a mission-aligned team and, should your project find success, it’s a way to effortlessly, transparently, and efficiently reward your team members and contributors.</p><p>Want more?

While you may or may not be creating a DAO, you should keep in mind that these very same governance systems can also be used informally to gauge your stakeholder interests in an effective and efficient way.</p><p>You can choose to give tokens at your own discretion, or set certain metrics and tokenomic tooling to automatically generate and disburse tokens based on contributions made to your project. The Juicebox difference is in the rich tooling our platform provides project creators.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-lifecycle-of-a-token-built-on-the-juicebox-protocol">The lifecycle of a token built on the Juicebox protocol<a class="hash-link" href="#the-lifecycle-of-a-token-built-on-the-juicebox-protocol" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>How a token is used within the Juicebox protocol varies on a number of different factors and project creator settings. Let’s take a look at one particular path to help give you some insight into the lifecycle of an average token.</p><p>You’ve created a project, and you’ve set a distribution limit (how much funding your project needs in a given time frame to keep the lights on). Let’s say that every two weeks your project needs to be bringing in $5,000. That amount will cover the costs of the team and any other expenses to keep your project running smoothly.</p><p>Now let’s say somebody comes along and puts $2000 into your project. In exchange for contributing those funds, they get some amount of tokens (how many is completely determined by you). Furthermore, you may want to keep some tokens every time someone contributes funds, so you set something called a <em>reserved rate</em>, which is what percentage of tokens you keep. Let’s say you do 10%. So now 10% of all tokens created goes back to your project and sits in a treasury.</p><p>Now fast forward. Many more people have contributed to your project, and at this point your distribution limit is still $5000 every two weeks, but on average you’re taking in a lot more than that. All those extra funds sit in your treasury. Those “extra” funds are called your <em>overflow</em>.</p><p>Now let’s say one of your early investors, who has a lot of tokens for your project, wants to move on and get rid of his tokens. Rather than simply ignoring them, he can claim a percent of the overflow in your treasury proportional to how many tokens he has. If he has a lot of tokens, even though he may have initially just given you $2000 in funding, his tokens could be traded in for far more than that if your overflow is sufficiently large.</p><p>What’s unique about this system is that it incentivizes contributors to your project to 1) stick around, and 2) to be actively invested in your success. Some people will never be interested in trading in tokens; they may see more utility in using the tokens for governance, or simply hanging on to them as a trophy and receipt of their contributions to you. However, for those who are hoping to eventually cash out with more than they invested, the token redeeming exchange allows for this scenario if your project has become sufficiently successful.</p><p>Let’s say that first investor burns all his tokens, and gets back $3000. He’s made a profit of one thousand dollars. By redeeming the tokens, he has taken them out of circulation and they have been destroyed. He’s made $1000 in the exchange, and you managed to attract an investor early on when you needed funding more.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="an-overview-of-juicebox-tooling">An overview of Juicebox tooling<a class="hash-link" href="#an-overview-of-juicebox-tooling" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>Where Juicebox really shines is in its ability to give project creators full control over the tooling they wish to employ in their projects. There is a rich help section along with a glossary on info.juicebox.money, but for a brief overview read on to learn some of the basics.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="distribution-limit">Distribution Limit<a class="hash-link" href="#distribution-limit" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>The easiest way to think of this is by answering this question: how many funds do you need to keep the lights on for your project, and how frequently do you need them? Do you have a dev team that needs to be paid, or server hosting fees, a content writer, etc.? Whatever those costs amount to will tell you the amount of funds you need to keep your project stable and going forward.</p><p>Do you need $2000 every two weeks? $1000 every ten days? $5000 a month? Whatever time and amount you need is what you will declare as your “distribution limit” when you create a JB project.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="overflow">Overflow<a class="hash-link" href="#overflow" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>If your project receives more funds than you declared in your distribution limit, those extra funds will sit in a treasury. These extra funds are called overflow. Token holders can at any time redeem their tokens (trade in their tokens) for a portion of the value of overflow in your project. If your project has huge overflow because it has become very successful, then token holders can get a piece of that success by redeeming their tokens.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reserve-rate">Reserve Rate<a class="hash-link" href="#reserve-rate" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>The reserve rate is what percentage of tokens you keep every time you mint tokens. You can set this anywhere from zero to one hundred percent or in between. Setting a reserve rate allows your project to accrue tokens. Not having a reserve rate means that all tokens you mint will go to contributors.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="redemption-rate">Redemption Rate<a class="hash-link" href="#redemption-rate" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>The redemption rate is something you set that determines how much value redeemed tokens will have based on when they are redeemed. If somebody redeems their tokens right away, they will get less proportional overflow value than someone who waits until later to redeem their tokens. A redemption rate incentivizes people to stick around as your project grows, and it disincentivizes investors who are just looking to make a quick buck. You can set an aggressive or weak redemption rate, or none at all, when you create a Juicebox project.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="weight">Weight<a class="hash-link" href="#weight" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>The term <em>weight</em> simply means how many tokens or other assets, such as NFTs, a contributor will receive for a set amount of contribution. For instance, a contributor who puts $1000 into your project may receive a million tokens (if you so choose).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="burning-versus-redeeming-tokens">Burning versus Redeeming tokens<a class="hash-link" href="#burning-versus-redeeming-tokens" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Whenever someone gives back their tokens, those tokens are destroyed permanently. If a token holder gives back tokens for a share of the overflow, we call this “redeeming” the tokens. Let’s say, however, that there is no overflow. In that case, the tokens are still traded in and destroyed, but they don’t yield any value back. When this happens, we call it “burning” tokens.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together<a class="hash-link" href="#putting-it-all-together" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>The importance of JB really sits with the excellent tooling suite you receive by using it.

So for the last few funding Cycles, we&#x27;ve been operating in two experiments, which has been really great. These align with the Juicebox funding Cycles, I&#x27;ll drop a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/jbx-protocol/projects/1/views/20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> in the town hall chat for those who haven&#x27;t seen it before. So we&#x27;re basically scheduling issues every two weeks that is aligned with the JuiceboxDAO funding cycle. And I think what we&#x27;re going to plan to do is to give a recap of the previous funding cycle every two weeks. So next week, we&#x27;ll give a recap of all the stuff that was done in the last two weeks, which is going to be really really great this time around there&#x27;s been so much done. So definitely don&#x27;t want to miss that. </p><p>I want to highlight one quick fun feature. That was merged yesterday. So this is the ability to add Banny stickers to Memos, which is a small thing, but potentially a fun feature which some of you have been enjoying. So thank you for everyone who worked on that particularly JohnnyD who led the implementation. Check <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnnyD_eth/status/1536600334507843586" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JohnnD&#x27;s twitter</a> for a video demo of this.</p><p>There&#x27;s four big things in flight at the moment. And I&#x27;ll list them out in order of the time that they&#x27;ll be shipped more or less. </p><ol><li>The first is giving projects the ability to relaunch on V2 and giving token holders the ability to migrate their tokens to the V2 project.</li><li>Second is V2 project handles, which is being led by Peri. Right now projects on V2 don&#x27;t have handles like they did in V1 so that is adding support for those. </li><li>The third is NFT rewards for projects. Essentially it&#x27;s giving projects the ability to specify like if you contribute a certain amount of funds to this project, then we will reward you with an NFT. So that&#x27;s going to be really exciting giving projects another avenue to get funding which is great. </li><li>And then the fourth is obviously veBanny and staking.</li></ol><p>So I will quicking give an overview of what&#x27;s in store with V1 V2 migration, basically we need to give V1 projects the ability to relaunch on V2. So the canonical example is juiceboxDAO. We&#x27;re a V1 projects. We also now have a V2 project but none of our funds are in the V2 project.</p><p>What&#x27;s gonna happen is the projects will re-launch on V2, JuiceboxDAO has already done that so we have a project on V2. They&#x27;re then gonna move their whole balance to the V2 project. They&#x27;re going to add another payment terminal to the V2 project, and this is a special payment terminal where it&#x27;ll accept a V1 token and then return the V2 token in a 1:1 exchange rate.</p><p>So basically if I have Juicebox V1 token, there&#x27;ll be a place in the interface to go to swap my V1 tokens for the new V2 tokens. And that&#x27;s pretty much it. So the contracts are more or less done. Thank you to jango Dr.Gorilla and whoever else worked on that. That was really quick turnaround. And now it&#x27;s pretty much up to the front end to get the UI done for all of what I just explained. And then we&#x27;ll finally have upgrade path to some V1 projects to get on V2 and use all the cool new stuff. </p><p><strong>@peri</strong>: I think as everybody knows we still aren&#x27;t supporting project handles for the new V2 projects. And this is basically just has to do with some of the changes that are made in the contracts. We used to store a handle for a project on chain and it requires a lot of extra finessing in the contracts because we had to make sure that people can use the same contract and that handles could be transferred and reserved for certain period of time and claimed, there&#x27;s a lot of functionalities to bake in. So with the V2 project contracts, we just skipped over all that because it ended up not being very necessary for the functionality of the contracts themselves. But the downside of course is that it&#x27;s really nice to have in the app to be able to look up projects and search for projects.</p><p>So we&#x27;ve been working on another layer, another contract to add into the existing contracts that will support handles for V2 projects. It is not quite finished and it&#x27;s not on mainnet yet.  But we do have everything kind of functionally together so I can give a demo of how it&#x27;ll work in the app and explain how it works pretty quickly.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/zh/assets/images/njwILOI-d2fd6e7b5384dbdd906a0c382e8540e1.png" width="1280" height="1438" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><em>(screen sharing ongoing)</em></p><p>So I&#x27;ve got this empty project here on Rinkeby, ID 4117.  And we are going to set a handle for this project. </p><p>We&#x27;ve got a two-transaction-process for setting a project handle. And so the way that this works is we decided to use ENS names to handle the uniqueness of project handles what I mentioned earlier for making sure that handles be passed around and exchanged. There&#x27;s a lot of complexity there that ENS has already solved really beautifully and so we built the system around ENS names. The idea here is that if you want to use a handle for a project you will need to own the matching ENS name. So for example, I just got this ENS name on rinkby testinginprod.eth and this would allow me to set the handle of this project to testinginprod. So I&#x27;m gonna do two steps here,</p><ol><li>I have to own this ENS name first of course,  I&#x27;m going to set the ENS name testinginprod.eth and this would be one transaction. Once this completes, step one will be done.</li><li>The next step here is to actually set a text record on the ENS name. So if anybody&#x27;s used the ENS name app before you&#x27;ll know that you can come down and set these text records for any number of different things. We are using a particular key &quot;Juicebox project ID&quot;. You can come and set this property in the ENS name app manually if you want, but that&#x27;s a little bit of extra work. So we&#x27;ve made it nice, pretty and clean in the app and you can basically come down here and click this button and we&#x27;re gonna set that value in the ENS name text record to the ID of this project. So this one is 4117. So I&#x27;m going to send this transaction, which is the same as if I just came over here and just manually put 4117 here. That&#x27;ll show up here if you got the handle set up.</li></ol><p>Most importantly that&#x27;ll allow your project to be searched on the projects page. Right now the search bar works by searching for project handles and V2 projects don&#x27;t have handles you can&#x27;t search for them. It&#x27;s very lame that is now a thing of the past as soon as you set a handle for your project. Your project will be searchable. </p><p>An important thing to note is that either of these things change, for example if you were to transfer the ENS name and someone else changes that text record, your handle will go back to empty. So you have to have both of these things set constantly or if you were to change this to some other ENS name, your handle would go back to empty.</p><p>Another fun fact is you can also actually do subdomains here. </p><p>We will hopefully have that on mainnet this week. I&#x27;m pretty sure we&#x27;re doing. some just some last-minute things, but mostly everything is good to go. So expect it pretty soon. </p><p><strong>@0xSTVG:</strong> So does that mean that I could create multiple projects with subdomains of my ENS?</p><p><strong>@peri</strong>: You could. But you can&#x27;t have multiple projects using the same ENS name. So if you had like STVG.eth, and you want to do like one project one.STVG.eth and the other project two.STVG.eth, those could be two separate handles for different projects.</p><p>@mieos: Once we get that up and running, I think a screen recording of you going through that or WAGMI can put together a little infographic on what it is and how it works, especially when it gets up to the subdomain part, it&#x27;s just technical enough. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="vebanny-by-jmill">veBanny by @Jmill<a class="hash-link" href="#vebanny-by-jmill" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>I want to show a map with the veBanny stuff. I&#x27;ve been doing some work on the subgraph implementation to index the user tokens and interact with them. Right now we had a couple of big steps forward. One thing is there&#x27;s now a metadata file to parse for all the the characters or the variants so you can go through and scroll through the characters and figure out which one you want and then you can see them all in here, too. So that&#x27;s been a nice upgrade because you can pull that all from one place now.</p><p><em>(screen sharing ongoing)</em></p><p>So these are NFT positions that I&#x27;ve taken on this account. So you like lock positions that are actually coming from on chain. And then you can interact with them also, so I can do that to extend the lock or I can unlock the ones that have finished. So I can take this one and extend the lock like a thousand days. Then it takes a minute for the graph to re-index it, but it&#x27;ll show up 30 seconds later with the new lockdate.</p><p>And then other than that I showed this last week, we have a new contract where you can mint for one second just like test the unlock and redeem stuff. But yeah, I showed this on the last demo where you can  also like take a staking position and actually mint these things through the front end works also. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="quizz-time">quizz time:<a class="hash-link" href="#quizz-time" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="/zh/assets/images/AME442G-b0e7abeb37a8aa055a5a588739f9df56.png" width="954" height="515" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The answer is....</p><p><strong>Nicholas</strong></p><ul><li>As a student I made jewelry and garment. </li><li>I was a nationally ranked debater.</li><li>I haven&#x27;t been Malta before.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="nft-update-by-johnnyd">NFT update by @JohnnyD<a class="hash-link" href="#nft-update-by-johnnyd" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p><strong>@JohnnyD</strong>: I&#x27;ll just add a few sentences to what @aeolian has summarized before.

According to @Zeugh, they came from several big Telegram chat groups that are mainly focused on airdrops. There might be a misintrepretation that if they create a project on rinkeby.juicebox.money and give feedback in the Discord server, they will be entitiled to some kind of Juicebox airdrop. <strong>We don&#x27;t have any airdrop currently.</strong></p><p><strong>Zeugh</strong>： I think it won&#x27;t do any substantial harm to JuiceboxDAO, and think it a great opportunity to showcase the functionalities of our protocol to these people, and to onboard some new members who are really interested in our products.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="vebanny-front-end-updates-by-jmill">veBanny Front End updates by @Jmill<a class="hash-link" href="#vebanny-front-end-updates-by-jmill" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p><strong>Jmill</strong>: I have been working pretty extensively on the veBanny front end, trying to get it out the door. Now that the contracts are deployed, we can work to transactions and use real data.</p><p>(<em>sharing screen and demonstrating the process of staking tokens for an Locked NFT</em>)</p><p>So we&#x27;re now minting this thing through the website which is cool. The stuff is all working now, and show up pretty cool.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: I&#x27;ve also been on the contract side of things that @Viraz has been doing a great job, asking for reviews over the tests. The tests he&#x27;s writing and adding more fuzzing tests to the suite. So hopefully at this point, it&#x27;s throwing a lot of use cases at the cocept. And i suppose it&#x27;ll make way on to the actual final details to complete the workflow.</p><p><strong>Jmill</strong>: The big thing next is to read the onchain data and get the use of NFT, and then allow them to extend their locked positions on a particular NFT. All of those are related to fetching data, about multiple tokens. We&#x27;re talking about this in Peel&#x27;s Discord, and right now it&#x27;s implemented as ERC-721 Enumerable, but it&#x27;ll probably be easier if it were structured similiar with Juicebox projects where you have a directory structure and subgraph, to look that information up without recursive calls to open by index. So that&#x27;s probably what we need to start thinking about how we index these information for the purpose of front end to grab it and work with the data. </p><p><strong>jango</strong>: Yeah, that makes sense. Also from a juiceboxDAO or Juicebox perspective in Juicebox.money, we&#x27;ll possibly first have to deploy their staking contract and specify the lock duration they want etc. It isn&#x27;t going to be there for everyone first, they have to specify those things, so that that initial transaction to deploy a staking contract will go through a contract that somewhat serve as a directory or at least it&#x27;ll file an event that&#x27;s indexable to service a directory. If Peel and Juicebox.money feel it a decent thing to offer all projects over time and they should be able to interact with that same depolyer contract to get their own version of this.</p><p><strong>filipv</strong>:What&#x27;s the timeline looking like? Is that somehting we can expect deploying in the next month?</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: We need V1 &gt; V2 migration to do it for JuiceboxDAO. We can deploy this for an arbitrary project though. We can launch a new project and just has it work there, so you can start minting stuff, just as normal treasury and lock it there, at which point there&#x27;s not much difference between test and rinkeby as we currently are. But to get the JuiceboxDAO version of this and the Bannyverse version at least from a ecosystem perspective, we need to get V1 &gt; V2 migration, and then there might be other technical things along the way.</p><p><strong>Jmill</strong>: From a front end perspective, there are a couple of things that would be helpful so that there&#x27;s some kind of indexing data you can easily pull user&#x27;s NFT statistics. That&#x27;s a more simple and scalable way to do with subgraph query. It would be really usefull if the ve NFT contract deployer also deploy a single consolidated metadata file. Let&#x27;s say veBanny has 60 characters and they all have a name and staking ranges, it&#x27;ll be really nice that the contract generate that as one file that front end could grab and parse to display without going to 60 metadata files individually. That would be a quality-of-life thing from the contract side for the front end.</p><p><strong>tankbottoms</strong>: We could add another function for that metadata, basically something that will conform with an NFT but also has pointers to all assets you need, because you can pick them through the JSONs however you want.</p><p><strong>Jmill</strong>: The last item I have here is that we&#x27;re implementing beneficiary for this, so that users can stake and put someone else as the beneficiary.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: That&#x27;ll be useful for even a DAO to lock its supply, and designate other contributor or some other beneficiary for. It&#x27;s cool to have flexibility. The core thing being built allows everyone on the peripheral of the project to start to wrap their heads around what situation it&#x27;s gonna be when this thing is out there.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="product-prospective-with-zeugh">Product prospective with @Zeugh<a class="hash-link" href="#product-prospective-with-zeugh" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="/zh/assets/images/ktQrGSS-a6a1f2e23428f4842bea76122e9ce4af.png" width="1830" height="698" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>Zeugh</strong>: The Juicebox.money is a complex thing to use. I think it will be something to see that front end are more focused on some type of projects. Let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s a NFT project wants to launch its treasury on Juicebox, they can have a direct way for easy launch to help set it up ahead of time. You want to launch a NFT project and make the funds through Juicebox so people can co-own the treasury like tileDAO did and issue tokens for people that are minting.</p><p>Those are some of the configurations that we think we should do. That could be something like Juicebox.nft instead of Juicebox.money. And if you want to go to the hard mode and be able to configure every single thing, that&#x27;s still running on the same protocol.</p><p>That&#x27;s what I call the product prospective. We have a very good protocol perspective here that is building something really robust and can do lots of things. In the end looking at product level, maybe not all the users will need all of these things and having an easy way to launch might be something interesting.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: I think there&#x27;s a lot of to keep improving the onboarding stuff and especially we just came out of V2 trying to start with parity where V1 was. The name of the game now is just constant improving based on our own interest with onboarding as well as pulling together other people&#x27;s perspective. It&#x27;s hard to be certain that it&#x27;s one thing or another thing from my point of view, but without question we&#x27;re going to hinge towards better alternatives to prototypes that are massively useful. Shout out to JohnnyD and Aeolian and all the people in Peel who are eager and quick to make prototypes and start discord threads so that we can discuss the improvements. And then match this with a occasional AHA moment that a few different ideas come together that make sense to a lot of folks and somehow we unlock a lot more fluidity to the onboarding process. </p><p>I&#x27;m certainly with you that we have a lot of work to do with explaining what people are getting into, like starting with giving everyone all the information upfront and make all risks as clear as possible. Overtime we can start to reel back into some managable shortcuts. </p><p>I think now we&#x27;re definitely buckling for more long term investments both from a building perspective and the relationship perspective with other communities. I&#x27;m eager to see how that project chart changes over time. I think from my personal perspective and talking to projects, the recent lows haven&#x27;t been very encouraging for projects to launch. But now that V2 is out, we&#x27;re going to see a lot more of that.</p><p><strong>nicholas</strong>: When I did onboarding with Austin from BuildGuild and he had some feedback about simplifying. It&#x27;s a little bit difficult for someone on the outside to know exactly which simplifying approach will be successfull on the market aside from just iterating on simplifying the existing one. But I do have some suspicion that there are a larger category of people who are not so inclined to use Juicebox in its current form but might be inclined to do so for this example we&#x27;re talking couple of times about NFT collections, splitting off a portion of their primary and/or secondary to Juicebox and letting the holders manage it, which doodles, cryptopunks and a bunch of other projects already do. That&#x27;s a category I&#x27;m super interested in getting on the creation flow for that. It could be just like presets on what we&#x27;ve already got, or maybe an entirely separate creation flow where you can imagine entirely different front ends that just make creation really tight for a specific use case and then you can go use Juicebox.money&#x27;s full advanced front end and subsequently managing those things but make it easier for people to get onboard. It could be pretty integrated at Juicebox.money. There&#x27;s a lot to explore.</p><p><strong>filipv</strong>: One thng that we&#x27;ve discussed that might be interesting would be if there&#x27;s a way to easily import and export project configurations which Austin Griffith originally brought up, for exporting a project that was made on testnet to mainnet. That might be cool because you can use that feature to set up templates that have base project configurations.</p><p>Another thing I want to talk about is what we&#x27;re discussing a lot in the chat about amount of metrics. I&#x27;m not sure how useful focusing on any specific North Star metric would be. It&#x27;s very hard to encapsulate everything in Juicebox, and I think everything is conflating with each other. So I think we can take anything and roll with it, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worthy going super deep into which is the best North Star metric.</p><p><strong>Aeolian</strong>: I&#x27;m totally with @filipv. I think the goal I originally had with proposing this metric was not so much like &quot;ok! Let&#x27;s review this number every week!&quot; or &quot;Oh! it&#x27;s going down, what&#x27;s happening?&quot; It&#x27;s more like what we&#x27;re all in some sense collectively optimizing for everything from a product, website, documentation and content strategy, the whole thing. Our goal right now is to increase the number of active projects. I agree with you that at this stage where traffic is still very low, really trying to hatch out a metric that&#x27;s instructive right now. It&#x27;s more to get us all on the same page.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: I think the general consensus is that it feels good to have activity. I guess you could put on a chart and optimize for it, but personally I want to think about metrics that make me lean in more in moment&#x27;s notice seeing activities, and seeing folks I know engaging with other projects making me want to learn more about them.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="govenance-discussion">Govenance discussion<a class="hash-link" href="#govenance-discussion" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p><strong>@filipv</strong>: I want to open up some discussion on the recent governance cycle, both in itself and some of the proposals. </p><p>One thing I want to bring up first is the possibility of changing the governance cycle in order to allow for longer temperature checks because I definitely feel the temp check are too short. But there&#x27;s also balance if you lengthen the temp check, it makes it harder to get things through the governance process and it takes longer to get things done. We did a poll and people are really into the weekday idea.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/zh/assets/images/nG8Bn2D-7b9c7c25f95d53b41aefb6272167a809.png" width="772" height="668" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>nicholas</strong>: Since people prefer temp check ends during the week, I&#x27;d particularly like the proposal edit freeze to happen during the week, because I had to spend a lot of Sundays modifying proposals because people obviously just give comments leading up to the freeze and I prefer it end in the week. I understand people have jobs and I am certain that might not be convenient, but people from the poll seem to be happy with that idea.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: For me personally, it&#x27;s nice to end on weekend because I can do a lot more meeting oriented and dev oriented stuff during the week, and in the weekend, I can read the proposals and think about those. There&#x27;s not much weekend breaktime.</p><p><strong>nicholas</strong>: How specified should proposals be? I made a suggestion that is three points if you add them to the proposals,
<img loading="lazy" src="/zh/assets/images/GbRQJsd-14e72c17e289c704f7e2a262f74a288e.png" width="2020" height="946" class="img_ev3q">
maybe they will enable more delegation, because a lot of the burden getting the proposal through can be like knowing exactly what steps should be taken, when it&#x27;s not always necessary DAO knows every single steps if DAO is willing to accept the risks, the implementation risk of someone delegating it to the person who&#x27;s the author or someone specified in the proposal. I think it&#x27;s a decent choice if it&#x27;s a better financial allocation and also adding a risk in risk section which is like &quot;Look, we&#x27;re not specifying the address the money got set to, we don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a super important detail for the DAO to be voting on&quot;, but that&#x27;s a risk we can screw up sending it to a wrong address because it wasn&#x27;t specified in the proposal. It allow the proposal to move forward before all those details are sorted out. Some proposal do deserve to have hyper detailed specifications and it&#x27;s important for the DAO to vote on it, others delegation will be more appropriate. I think that might be a interesting format for making governance more manageable. </p><p><strong>filipv</strong>: I&#x27;m definitely onboard with that. I think that thing need to be weighted very carefully just because it&#x27;s not like we are going through a hierachy and people are revising it in every step. It&#x27;s kind of like every proposal goest to the multisig like the one source of truth. It&#x27;s like something running close to the middel very powerful and very dangerous. I think we need to be careful about specifications and and we don&#x27;t want to lead to some DAO crisis when people are disagreeing on an interpretation of the proposal after the fact.</p><p>First of all it waste a bunch of time, also people are gonna get upset and may lead to conflicts. So I am generally more of a stickler that we should have very specific proposals just because how dangerous it is. I wonder if there is a way to incentivize people to submit a bunch of proposals earlier so they can be spread out ever a greater period of time. We really see most proposal submitted close to the end of temp check. It&#x27;s not an easy question to solve.</p><p><strong>nicholas</strong>: Part of the challenge is the 14days cycle, if you would like to submit a proposal for something and temp check submission just opened, that means you  can no longer submit a proposal and you could be waiting for 20+ days till the next opportunity to vote. It may be worthwhile, for instance the bug bounty, I can see both sides on it, maybe a longer process allow us to consider, but at the same time, the protocol needs the bounty pretty badly. </p><p>I think it would be of some value not entirely in the direction of everything being specified because the reality is that just making through all of that governance and having opinions on it is stretching the limits of the bandwidth of even the most dedicated members of the DAO. It also becomes less decentralized the more because people are just voting along with other people who have already voted. There&#x27;s also some needs to us to recognize that actually the DAO doesn&#x27;t need to vote on every single details of everything, and some amount of delegation is probably gonna be necessary over the medium term. </p><p><strong>filipv</strong>: Two thoughts on that.</p><p>One is that I don&#x27;t see why we couldn&#x27;t do it right now like approving a budget in advance to reduce future governance overhead and go through that process. I think that&#x27;s very achievable and I&#x27;m interested in pursuing that.</p><p>Second thought is that jango has be mentioning lately the idea of possibly pursuing funding for projects and budgets for projects rather that fuding budgets for individuals or groups, which I think compelling because the structure of what we are doing shifts a lot and it&#x27;s the post V2 transitory period. So I wonder maybe a shift towards budgeting for things get done rather than having all these smaller individual small group proposals may accomplish what you are talking about being able to improve things in advance and delegates to someone who&#x27;s leading the project.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: Some of the treasury allocations have also been tricky in the past weeks because we&#x27;ve been tuning the treasury create stuff on and off while we address some protocol problem. Those should be made well in advance in proposals being specified to be directed towards them. I am definitely in the camp of more hyper specificity upfront and throughout the temp check process.</p><p><strong>filipv</strong>: Would you want to work with Juicebox if you didn&#x27;t get funding through an individual basis, but rather as a part of multiple projects?</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: The end of payment routing is still individual payout, either from a project that you control like what JohnnyD has, or through a direct payment from a project. The idea is that it&#x27;s just not managed by a conglomerate governance system.</p><p><strong>felixander</strong>: I want to talk with JohnnyD and Aeolian about this. What happens when you bring a human on for a projects and the project is solved? It doesn&#x27;t make sense for the system now because we&#x27;ve committed a budget to something that only took 2-3 months, but now somebody is there, but they&#x27;re taking on another work that might be totally separating them from what they&#x27;re doing. I think it&#x27;s something a little bit messy in terms of how the payment structure works presently.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: I feel that kind of work is really important when a project is starting out, that&#x27;s still the case now and will likely still be months into the future. There&#x27;s a lot happening and everyone is contributing to whatever the next person needs. So people are just shouting &quot;hey I got this dope thing in progress, it&#x27;d be sweet if I could have this ounce of help&quot; and luckily there&#x27;s a lot of people around who are eager and feeling supportive to do that work. So the individual payouts feel appropriate in that world.</p><p>I think that would set the expectation that there&#x27;s a lot of stuff that we&#x27;ve building isn&#x27;t just onging forever, we&#x27;re not hired by JuiceboxDAO to be here comfortably and feel valued imbued and viewed by our relationship to one another and to the concept of the projects. Once those projects play themselves out, I think it&#x27;s healthy to reassess what our purpose is amongst current state of the projects and how we can prepare ourselves for future state of uncertainty which are always upon us. That&#x27;s the thing we can almost guarantee. </p><p><strong>felixander</strong>: Would that be the same way like Peel, WAGMI and Canu, the idea that people would branch off like Peel now is under a budget to do front end? You could imagine people who are doing docs would branch out and have a budget, and people who are doing translation would also branch off and have a budget.</p><p><strong>jango</strong>: I think that&#x27;s in a creative part and I&#x27;m sure everyone will bring their own taste of how to frame these things. It&#x27;s effective to pay Peel to work on the Juicebox.money project, front end developers can assess each other&#x27;s contributions and payouts better than any multidisciplinary group would.</p><p>These things will inevitably shift and change over time, as people come and go, as well as the projects changing. It&#x27;s tougher for the community to rationalize consistent budgeting for an abtract group of people with an abtract but pointed mission, the individuals are liquid between all these project organizaitons and we hve to respect that. People are going to find their leverage over time and they don&#x27;t owe anything to any organizations. We&#x27;re all just building ourselves out and learning from each other in  this whole process. I think we&#x27;re going to see a lot of different ways to organize it.</p><p>Shout out to Zom_Bae creating the Juicebox events version for the upcoming ice cream event and it&#x27;s in a potential to add more longevity to that concept. What if we&#x27;re to actually trying to fund events consistently and have a pool of resources that we can make this up every single time. We can just re-reference something that we know to be true already.</p><p>I think we&#x27;re on the same page eventually. We&#x27;ve got to create the right incentive model to shift away from building up the Juicebox foundation to supporting one in any numbers of projects and then servie it to the world and make it the gateway. But as the protocol tends towards stability, it&#x27;ll be great to have tighter articulation of what it means for a project to succeed over time.</p><p><strong>Aeolian</strong>: I do like what @casstoshi brought up about the idea of each group having a budget and individual contributors are paid from that budget. I think Peel has done this. At a time all the front end people were doing individual proposals to JuiceboxDAO and the sentiment was that it&#x27;s hard to evaluate these proposals. So intead JuiceboxDAO votes on a single budget for front end and that team can handle that budget as they see fit.</p><p>I&#x27;ll post a <a href="https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp68-modify-protocol-engineering-core-unit-budget-pe-001/13797" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> that Drgorilla posted earlier about how makerDAO manages this process where there&#x27;s a clear budget for each abstract collecton of people. It definitely breaks down as we&#x27;ve seen with some proposals over the last couple of weeks. It&#x27;s hard to pinpoint someone into one of those particular groups, people can work ver much across thses groups.</p><p>I still think it&#x27;s instrutive not only from accounting perspective but also from an organizational perspective, it just makes it easy to reason about someone&#x27;s payout if they&#x27;re clearly contributing to a specific area.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-highlights">Project highlights<a class="hash-link" href="#project-highlights" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p><strong>gogo</strong>: I&#x27;m very glad to be able to discover the future of ComicsDAO and strategy of what we&#x27;re gonna do there.

What I would like to propose is that this is our heroes Banny and they&#x27;re travelling throught the DAO galaxy to DAOs. We would like to know where JuiceboxDAO would like the ship to go to the next DAO, so that we can keep on building covers to next DAO.

And as jango mentioned in  his twitter that Juicebox front end is based on scaffold-eth. </p><p>So it&#x27;s very cool to see comfort circle, and hopefully we will be able to fund a modest hackathon to get the treasury kickstarted with funds, hopefully getting that brew of hackers into the ecosystem. </p><p>@twodam&#x27;s has posted a twitter about this week&#x27;s projects <a href="https://twitter.com/twodam_eth/status/1534200052511518720" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

Thank you @nicholas for doing a lot. Most excited once we get the V1 V2 token stuff, situated to start talking to the SharkDAO, or a lot of folks operating on V1 still doing ongoing work and fundraising, to see if they want to move over and leverage some of the new tools to make their projects more successful, whatever that means to them these days.

Bug updates by @jango<a class="hash-link" href="#1-bug-updates-by-jango" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>@Jango: The same bug update that I presented about last week that we caught about a week ago. As of a few mins ago about 95% got resolved to just the final step of re-issuing the tokens for those who contributed to projects before we re-deployed things. </p><p>Everything is being tracked in the <a href="https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2/blob/main/security/postmortem/5.24.2022.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">postmortem</a> that is the V2 contract repository. I’m very excited to tie that off and make progress on all other stuff coming up. Also project creation is back up.</p><p>filipv: I am gonna ask about litDAO specifically. Are they holding back token narration for all projects right now?</p><p>jango: We’re gonna run a script to help go through play by play of what we’re doing. We re-deployed basically all the contracts except for Juicebox projects(so they can keep their NFT i.e. the ownership to the projects) and a few auxiliary contracts that don’t have dependency. We re-deployed the token contract, funding cycle store, the terminals, etc. Once projects re-launch their funding cycles, everyone starts from Funding cycle #1 again. The front end made it very easy to use the same configurations as their previous funding cycle in the old contract had. Once they make that, they also have 0 token supply in the new token contract. But several projects have already received funds and started distributing tokens.</p><p>The original plan was to have project owners initiate a few transactions to airdrop tokens to their token holders, which is super doable but requires 3-4 transactions and it’s a bit complicated. In general, the scope of the problem is very small, given where we are in the protocol deployed a few weeks ago. So instead, I’m gonna send a few transactions that we scripted after this Town Hall that’s gonna deposit and basically re-created the activities for each project. Let’s say moonmars have received 10 payments each with its memo and it beneficiary of token. We’ll just send those out again. And from the deployer wallet as we run the script, we will pay in some ETH and set the original beneficiary of tokens as a beneficiary. So once all the activities are up again, then the token balance of each project should reflect their old token balance. I’ll open a proposal to refund the deployer.</p><p>@filipv: So are we repaying all the balance that all the V2 projects have received so far?</p><p>@jango: I think the total will be 11ETH if all projects are to relaunch funding cycles, which is a prerequisite, and then we’ll drop the funds in both as a bonus for everybody for the hiccup, and also thanks for the patience throughout this process. I think it’s better to solve this problem with money, than to cause poor UX, and I think it’s worthy given its scale. But this also taught us a lot about how to solve this problem given a larger scope. That loss is in lieu of communication headaches that cause us to make sure that the projects are clicking the right button and not getting themselves into other nuts. </p><p>@filipv: Are we doing reimbursement for gas fees associated with redeployment and project updates?</p><p>@jango: Yes. The big one is projects that have deployed ERC-20, which is the most expensive transaction. We have a list of projects that have that before, and we’ll drop in 0.2ETH in their treasury, which is part of the number I quoted before. After this call, I’ll run it and we’ll be super in the clear and make moves towards the stuff we were working on before.</p><p>@filipv: Last question, what’s going on with the ETH in the V2 projects right now on the old version of the contract? Can project creators just distribute it if they’d like to, or figure out what they’re gonna do with it?</p><p>@jango: For the most part those have been distributed. I went through to empty those out as the UI no longer interacts with them. You can always go to etherscan.io to pull them out. I think litDAO has a 100% overflow, so any funds in there can be redeemed by token holders. So if you did contribute to the DAO before, it’s now a fine time to go and redeem, or they can submit a reconfiguration on the old funding cycle to raise and pull funds out. It’s the bonus we’re going to give them if they want to go to the trouble to get those, which is for them to choose.</p><p>Once we found this bug, it was tempting for us to just keep our heads down, mitigate it and try to fix it. But communicating with projects and making sure everyone understands what’s going on is important, so it’s certainly cool to do stuff and prod. </p><p>It’s still pretty incredible that we found this bizarrely niche bug this early on. I’m pretty confident here going forward. It’s kind of weird to start and then already have a bug. I definitely understand if there’s a sense of hesitancy. I’ll have to work through that, give it time and put weight on it incrementally and regain trust in ourselves. I feel pretty good about it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-morgensterns-ice-cream-event-by-zom_bae-and-kenbot">2.

We, as a DAO, got to vote on 6 custom unique ice cream flavors, which is pretty cool. Check out <a href="https://juicebox.notion.site/ICE-CREAM-FLAVOR-SUBMISSIONS-c84ed139d9a64bf68099a210942b98db" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a>, and submit your crazy wacky creations by June 2. On that day we’ll get a list compiled and vote on Discord for the top 6, which are going to be tweaked and refined by Nicholas Morgenstern himself and then be served at our event over the 3 days.</p><p>Kenbot and I over the last week have been really digging into this and finding a way to make it more than just an ice cream social. And I think we’ve got a really unique opportunity here to bring some really cool projects into Juicebox and get them building in the protocol, and also really get the word out for Juicebox. </p><p>We’ve been talking for a long time that Juicebox hasn’t really done a whole lot of marketing other than our twitter, word of mouth, and the big one-off projects like ConstitutionDAO and AssangeDAO. We are still in early phases for that, but the ice cream social the way it’s building up is gonna be an event inside an event of NFT NYC. We’re going to have a schedule of things going on each day. We’d love to do some twitter space, AMA and podcast if we can.</p><p>Lexicon Devils are making a replica of this event in <a href="https://www.cryptovoxels.com/spaces/344a9048-9c09-462e-9d76-f292185922a9/play" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cryptovoxels.com</a> , which is pretty cool.</p><p>So any of you is gonna be in NY for this event and is willing and able and down to be a part of that, I really want you to be.</p><p>@kenbot: What we’re thinking about is we can have their windows as soon as we can get going. So we can have a week running up before the event to promote right in the space what we are gonna be doing there. The thought is who do we want to reach out to, who’s walking by that place, who’s in downtown NY at that time, and we want to capture and have them come back.</p><p>So that’s going to be ideas that we can have a theme of bringing creatives together, to open their Juicebox projects and fund their dream projects. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-stories-about-blockspilt-and-nft-berlin-by-zeugh">3. Stories about BlockSpilt and NFT Berlin by @Zeugh:<a class="hash-link" href="#3-stories-about-blockspilt-and-nft-berlin-by-zeugh" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>@Zeugh: Me and JohnnyD have been going around for the last week. We’ve started the idea of testing the gorilla marketing tactics, by going to some blockchain, Ethereum or NFT conferences. This time we went to BlockSplits in Croatia and NFT Berlin so far. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-blocksplits">1) BlockSplits<a class="hash-link" href="#1-blocksplits" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>We got to BlockSplit on Tuesday last week. First thing we swa was a panel of legal side of things about new regulations in the EU and it felt like this was the wrong place to be. We came to this event for 2 main goals. The first one was to do some user research, try to listen to people that are creating projects, and try to understand how they currently manage their treasury. And the other idea was to onboard some of them. The event ended up evolving into something we understand as Web2.5. BlockSplit Croatia was more of using  blockchain technologies on traditional startups. </p><p>Interesting insights from BlockSplit were, there were some L2 builders from Boba network and they were interested in how we can bring Juicebox to their L2. I found it unusual that there will actually be people building L2 looking for people to go into their chains. I talked to them and onboarded them to our server. They want to come on and discuss how they could help a process like this to happen. </p><p>Also from BlockSplit, there was a very interesting group called Resolute that focuses on web3 marketing. They got very interested in how we’re doing things and how they can help with that. I am bringing them to our server this week for them to take a look at our strategy discussion and the marketing part.</p><p>Everyone got interested in how we are doing things actually, no one has ever seen a DAO actually run and work with a profitable and functional business model. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-nft-berlin">2) NFT Berlin<a class="hash-link" href="#2-nft-berlin" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>From BlockSplit we flew to Berlin, and NFT Berlin was the opposite of BlockSplit, where most people were not directly involved with a project, they were mostly collectors and fans of the whole NFT fever.</p><p>In there we got in depth looks at what NFT creation could use Juicebox for. JohnnyD was amazing in focusing in how we can create better models using Juicebox, some templates or preset configurations that could be useful for NFT creators, to give their buyers or investors more confidence in investing, to make sure that if a rug pull happens everyone has time to pull back. Those features made everyone’s eyes shine.</p><p>We got in touch with NFT Club Berlin. They are a big local group of NFT investors and collectors. We have follow-up calls this week to show them how to use the templates so that they can start referencing that in their community.</p><p>The experience as a whole was great beyond the event itself. We stayed for the hackathon, helped people on the hackathon deploy or understand something about our products. We got invited for the ETH Barcelona to be part of the hackathon there to help them get DAO hackathon. They are interested in having us as the main DAO on that, because we were one of those that does have an actual toolkit and a workshop and content to provide for a hackathon. </p><p>And we faced the problem of gas fee in NFT Berlin again and again, for the fact that we only run on Ethereum was definitely a barrier for some project creators that we talked to.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-discussion">3) Discussion<a class="hash-link" href="#3-discussion" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>@filip: Do you feel like what you learned from those events changed your strategy? Do you still feel the same way about the strategy?</p><p>@Zeugh: I don’t know. I really don’t know, because the strategy has been going back and forth from different talks, so I’m not sure if I have a clear feeling before saying it has changed.</p><p>I definitely feel more confident on going projects to projects in an event, just talking about Juicebox, asking what people are doing and how they are doing. I learned better the right questions to ask to understand if we can provide value to them or not, and to learn why we can why we can’t.</p><p>I think the most beneficial part was the user research part beyond the few projects we onboarded. I think it was the biggest gain.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-quizz-time">4.

A bug saga by @jango<a class="hash-link" href="#1-a-bug-saga-by-jango" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>Jango: This morning STVG posted at the loose_thoughts channel: What if we could pause a project mid-Funding cycle? He was trying to play with the Marine County Swim Association project(this is a sweet event pulled off by STVG) to pause it since the event was finished. And through a series of botched configurations, the project ended up in a really weird state. The project’s current funding cycle is set to start on May 28th which makes no sense as the current funding cycle should always be active. </p><p>So at this point, something is for sure up or at least not served correctly or the front end isn’t interpreting correctly. That’s quick to check. The etherscan.io confirmed that the current funding cycle starts at a later day. I went to check the unit tests and there were a bunch of cases that I felt this was trying to cover and still passing. So I tried to create the situation exactly and was still struggling to do so. What ended up being the exact step to follow to recreate the bug which I eventually found was: if you create a funding cycle or configure a funding cycle with a duration and then let it roll over to the next funding cycle without reconfiguring, now you’re in the 2nd funding cycle, now you’re in the 2nd funding cycle of the 1st configuration. Then you configure the subsequent one, and before the current cycle is over, you reconfigure the subsequent one again to override the previous configuration. If you’re in this exact state, the 2nd reconfiguration, instead of being based on the 1st FC which you kinda rolling over onto, will be based on the funding cycle you are going to override. </p><p>That puts us in a weird state. The edge case was not covered in the tests. So I quickly wrote a test and confirmed it, before I found the one line to add to the contract to fix the problem to make the test pass, which I’ll post here:
<img loading="lazy" src="/zh/assets/images/code-e4c28620c5d5d721371c3e85652c998b.png" width="958" height="274" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>So once we identified the problem, sorry I&#x27;m kind of doing a realtime postmortem here and I’ll write this up later, then we can start to think about the solutions and consequences. Luckily V2 was deployed only recently and there are only 27 projects at the time. And most projects don’t have large volumes in their treasury either, the bug doesn’t affect the treasuries so funds are all safe, too. </p><p>All we are gonna do is letting these projects know that this condition exists, and from our point of view, we should probably make the adjustment in the funding cycle store which is a dependency like all other contracts or the core contracts in the ecosystem which is gonna nudge us towards republishing and redeploying the V2 contacts. </p><p>It’s not 100% sure that we need to redeploy the project contract, which will be nice with all the NFT stays. Even if we do, we can get in touch with all these projects, make sure they can redeploy on the new version, make sure funds get moved over and make sure token holders get airdropped the new supply of the token.</p><p>This comes in the name of diverse conversion stuff we have been talking about. We know we are working with fragile and delicate infrastructure. I am happy to catch this very early on in the process, as this V2 stuff just gets trickier over time. And then obviously if you  were to know about it and think about it maliciously, it’s an exploit if you want to use it in that way.</p><p>A big shout out to folks involved to kinda come through and help once we wrapped our heads around the issue. Peri came in right away and adjusted some of the front end to make sure new projects can not be created on juicebox.money. And shout out to STVG for clicking a button which you described as chaotic and you weren’t really sure if you miss-clicked a few things, or you did a couple of things twice because you forgot to do it. That ended up showing us the way.</p><p>It’s pretty mind-blowing that that was a test case we have yet to cover. And it’s hard to believe there are any more of these lingering. The scope of these contracts is pretty tight. I think V2 actually removed bits and pieces of funding cycles, so the V2 funding cycle store is way leaner than the V1 one. I haven’t checked if the contracts of V1 have the same vulnerability in it, but I actually don’t think they do because that piece of logic got reassessed. </p><p>@filipv: Huge shout out to everybody esp. STVG. This is so good that this was found now instead of 3 months from now.</p><p>@0xSTVG: I’ll ask my original question. Is there a way to pause? I’m in a 5-day funding cycle, I reached my goal so I wanted to just pause payment even though I am in the middle of the funding cycle. I can’t do that, I can pause it but it’s going to take effect only when the current funding cycle is over.
@jango: yeah, you can set up a pay delegate to revert the transaction if you’ve met a goal, you could write an extension that just does that if you want. But by default you can’t. Once we put it on the shelf then you’ll be able to pull it off the shelf and use it, but we have to build it out first.</p><p>It feels like it’s at a lighter moment now. Most of the morning was pretty tense on my end at least, and obviously we take these things very seriously, make sure we’re articulating this stuff correctly and documenting that correctly. I think we are still all gonna make it.</p><p>All V2 projects on the site currently have a sweet alert on them. Hopefully all the communities running on it, not just project owners we reached out, see this warning and get a heads up for what’s going on. Thank you Peri, for coming through.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/zh/assets/images/project-79494c1581f0f74e00746563a6f98954.png" width="952" height="496" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-demo-of-vebanny-by-0xba5ed">2. Demo of veBanny by @0xBA5ED:<a class="hash-link" href="#2-demo-of-vebanny-by-0xba5ed" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>I’ll give a quick refresher on what veBanny is for, as I don’t know if everyone here has heard about or seen it before. So, veBanny is a way to make sure everyone who’s voting in the governance is focused on the long term instead of the short term. It’s a way to lock your tokens, the longer duration you lock for, the more voting power you’ll get. When you do that, you’ll get veBanny NFT to represent your locked tokens. </p><p>(Screen sharing of demo starts)</p><p>In the future you don’t have to receive the ERC-20 to lock your position. And it allows the public to extend the lock.</p><p>@filipv: Can you explain very quickly what a public extension is?</p><p>@jango: By default, once you’ve created a lock, then it’ll linearly decrease when time ticks on. Let’s say you lock it for 100 days, tomorrow the lock will be 99 days. So to get the full voting power, which is a function of how many days between now and the end of the lock, you’ll want to extend the lock back to 100 days, which is a transaction that needs gas. But sometimes if you have someone to be able to go in and send that transaction to extend your lock, you can set that flag to True. </p><p>If you intend to keep a locked position, maybe you have a voting habit, or someone who can easily afford that transaction can go in and extend it for you. Or if you don’t choose that, we’ll have control over it so you can inch toward liquidity of your position at the rate that you choose. That thing was added as a result of discussion when this was being designed, that a lot of people want to keep their voting power full, but they might not want to be sending transactions regularly and this is precautionary. I don’t know at what frequency people will want to send that extension transaction on their own, but it was a quick flag to add that didn’t open up a lot of weird complexity, so we put it there.</p><p>@filipv: Is that something that can be reconfigured? Can I send a transaction to turn off the public extension on a position that I already have?</p><p>@jango: The owner can change that whenever.</p><p>@0xBA5ED: So here it is, I own it(finished locking position). So I’m going to take a pretty big risk right now because I haven’t tested this on the testnet yet. Because the minimum duration is a week to lock, so I made one veBanny a week ago. Just one, so I haven’t tested it yet. We’re going to redeem it, we’re going to unlock our tokens and redeem them for ETH from the overflow in one transaction. So let’s see.</p><p>@jango: This is another cool feature of the ve mechanism that is different from the traditional Curve ve mechanism on which this is based. Since Juicebox has redeem functionality, you can redeem your treasury tokens for the underlying treasury asset. At any point you can still redeem your locked position for the underlying treasury assets, independent of whether it&#x27;s locked or not. So you can have your tokens locked for a year, you’ll be able to get your JBX back until the year’s up. But you can burn your NFT to get your JBX to get the underlying treasury asset whenever.</p><p>@0xBA5ED: Exactly. So before I burn it, I thought that we just show the voting power actually decreasing. So this is my current voting power and every block that passes it’ll decrease. So this decreases linearly until all my NFTs expire, then I won’t have any voting power left.</p><p>@filipv: So is voting a function of block number, or a function of time and it’s just updating on block numbers?</p><p>@0xBA5ED: It’s a function of time operating on block numbers.  (redeeming…) So here it’s gone already. As you can see I burned the NFT which also burned the JBX that was locked and I got the ETH from  the overflow. I’m very happy that it works, actually I haven’t tested it yet. I know it was going to work, but still it’s a bit scary to do a demo live for the 1st time.</p><p>@Felixander: A quick question in what jango was talking about, but let’s say somebody buys an NFT and they lock 100 days, and on day 75 they want to get out and they burn everything. So you can burn the NFT and the JBX. If they went in let’s say for 100 dollars, then on day 75 if they burn everything they are not gonna get 100 dollars back right? Is that gonna depend on the value of JBX or how does that work?</p><p>@jango: They’ll be able to, all the underlying JBX are gonna be redeemed with the exact same function that the treasury normally redeems at. That doesn’t decrease linearly. The idea is probably the value of the JBX or the NFT, it’s literally the floor, so you might find more value in NFY by selling it on the market.</p><p>But the point of doing this is because they were functionalities actually fairly meaningful in the Juicebox ecosystem since we’re minting JBX open-endedly. So someone can come in right now and put in like 6m dollars worth of ETH and they basically get 50% of the JBX supply or whatever. If they weren’t trying to coordinate with the rest of us, they could take everyone’s assets then basically use that big pool of JBX to control whatever was there before. The point of redeeming is that if somebody does that in a way that’s not trying to integrate with the current system, then anyone who currently has JBX is basically getting a shit ton of money from this person who comes in, so anyone who doesn’t want to be a part of that ecosystem can redeem basically and leave with a big chunk of what was just poured in. So this is in a way to disincentivize this takeover thing. So we need to keep that mechanism in place regardless of if JBX is locked because if we lock it and don’t keep that mechanism in place, that vulnerability becomes larger. </p><p>@Felixander: One more question for the NFT profile page. Are we making a difference between different Bannies, obviously they have different histories and stats, or are we putting that in the NFT profile page or is it gonna be the same page and the info exists somewhere else on a website or something?</p><p>@tankbottoms: The thinking was just keep the metadata inside the veBanny strictly about Juicebox with the exception of the name of the character, the model and the description will be added as well as these characteristics, shadowness etc. Everything in the metadata for the token will be related to Juicebox and will speak about Juicebox. There’s a location where we could put a URL in the description in the external URL so that in the opensea UI when you go to a detail page you can jump to it. The thinking was to keep it specified to Juicebox. With that said, there’s something you can do when you load up a web page with CSS and Javascript. I am trying to do some animation with the token, so when you go to a detail page, we could put a hidden link in that people can click to jump to Bannyverse.</p><p>@Felixander: So the metadata will be the same except for the name? Or will the description model also be different?</p><p>@tankbottoms: All tokens will be unique to the lock duration. There’s 300 tokens of each range, e.g. 0-99, 100-199, up until 100m and there are five locked positions for each token. Those 300 will have metadata that says who the character is, what the duration lock is, their motto and their history. The name of the token will be the name of the character.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-vebanny-front-end-by-jmill">3. veBanny Front End by @Jmill:<a class="hash-link" href="#3-vebanny-front-end-by-jmill" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p> (demo undergoing……)</p><p>We have a deployment of this to Rinkeby now. I’m working on a contract reader actually populating those with real user data and then working on the transactions after that. The goal right now is to spend the next few days working on the contract reader transactions populating with real data and just moving the component around to where they need to go in the application and getting the front end of this at the door. </p><p>@mieos: I think this looks pretty great in this little side panel. I was skeptical about it, if we’re thinking how projects could launch a toggle over to set a locked voting token option and this sort of pops up in the UI of their project. Maybe it’s a lot of info and there’ll need to be a lot of education that goes with their community, but it’s great that it can all happen right here. For what it’s worth, I think it looks pretty good. Maybe it’s because I understand it, but it looks nice to see it in action.</p><p>@Jmill: I do agree with that because the flow for almost everything project management related is that it never takes you to a new screen entirely. Any other configuration you’re doing is out of the drawer or model, so you know that we can keep that paradigm for this also. I think it’s good that the actual controls of it are quite simple. If the user has 10 positions, there’s a good way to show that here without making them scroll forever.</p><p>@jango: We’re also getting rid of the delegates onchain in this contract, which might allow us to really get rid of it from the UI as well and we’re managing the delegates via other means like Snapshot and potentially to other stuff.</p><p>@mieos: I guess I missed that bit. I think that’s great, certainly simplifies the experience of a person who doesn&#x27;t need to learn what it means to delegate or take part in that same moment.</p><p>@jango: At this point, I think there’s still some research work for filipv on the best means. The Snapshot delegation strategy seems compelling, and there’s other schemas we’re thinking about. I think the goal of all this stuff long term is to get rid of the multisig. To get rid of the multisig we have to do some kind of on chain voting, and on chain voting can be expensive, so we have this delegation. I think there’s some creative ways we’ve been bubbling up in several veBanny related threads that seem really promising. The delegate stuff was a blocker for this to the voting weight stuff. I’m pretty confident that we can get rid of it from the design scope for the front end for the time being, we’ll work it back in later.</p><p>@Jmill: Just from a user’s standpoint, it’s a really touchy issue of how you open up this delegate picker and how do you decide what to show, which delegate option to show to the user. There wasn’t a really great answer there as far as implementing that in the rest of the UI. I’m just working from the mocks but it’s pretty easy to remove the delegate stuff.</p><p>@filipv: ENS sorted alphabetically and free delegate. One thing I should add about Snapshot delegation. There’re hybrid solutions you can do using safe snap to have on chain execution, but you still need off chain queuing, so I’m not confident in Snapshot delegation as a strategy long term on chain governance. It’s good for hybridized stuff and getting close to there, but ultimately there does need to be some form of delegation if we want to be fully on chain. But I imagine there’s other layers we can think about. </p><p>@jango: Yeah, the disposable token strategy (see <a href="https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/961007548553637970/974046109615931432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>) is very compelling to me. For now this project has a lot of merit and we still can lean on the same points of vulnerabilities that currently we are at. We’re having a multisig, having an on chain voting which seem fine tradeoffs for the time being as we work towards to study our future.</p><p>If we can eventually have these as soon as people start having these Banny characters representing their position in governance then we’re going to see these characters everywhere because it’s kind of like an identity in the community. So as you start voting on Snapshot, we can also roll out interfaces and take inspiration for the work that folks at NounsDAO are doing to kind of participate with your Banny and lean in to the stuff WAGMI is doing to extend that even further.</p><p>@mieos: I just love the idea of getting the Bannyverse and these veBanny off the ground, but I can’t wait till the next DAO actually just uses the same implementation of voting and either uses WAGMI or somebody else to create these stake tokens. I’m excited about this rolling out to other Juicebox projects and creating value from.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-product-roadmap-by-aeolian">4. Product Roadmap by @aeolian:<a class="hash-link" href="#4-product-roadmap-by-aeolian" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>@jango: The veBanny stuff is great but we can’t ship it yet because we don’t have V2 tokens up yet. And all the stuff that’s up depends on the V2 JBX being out. So we’re in a transition period of V1-V2. We’ve got to transition the V1 JBX to V2 JBX, and we’re currently talking about a few designs to do it. Coming off product roadmap discussion we’ve been having in the strategy channel, we are gonna focus on making sure folks have an easy way to pay their V1 JBX to the treasury and get their V2 tokens in return, and making it easy for other projects like SharkDAO for instance, to do the same. That way we can get a lot of V1 projects who are still using their treasuries in earnest onto V2 and then build these new features on there their folks can use. So I think that’s the area of focus for the time being and there&#x27;s a couple of ways to go about it. Aeolian do you want to hit up the current thought process?</p><p>@Aeolian: Totally. Quickly from Peel’s perspective and the front end perspective, as jango has said, the immediate focus is getting this V1-V2 migration flow done, designed and implemented. There’s a few different ways to go about it and jango said some good ideas in the strategy channel which everyone can check out. That’s our immediate priority. So Peel is going to return to development life cycle which is going to basically in line with Juicebox funding cycle, we&#x27;re currently on FC#22, and the work we get loosely scheduled, everyone can check out here on our Github project.</p><p>There are 3 main things we’ve been working on:
V1-V2 migration flow,
coming up with solution for handles for V2 projects which includes cool crossover with ENS names,
some iterations on payout splits UX that making that a little more intuitive which is pretty exciting as well.</p><p>We will be focused on these for the next 2 weeks to one month, ironing out little bugs that have come up in V2 and refining experience alongside these big features.</p><p>And beyond that, we had really good discussions in the strategy channel. Definitely encourage everyone to come hang out there and drop ideas.</p><p>I think the overarching alignment is to figure out how to get more activities on the network and more long term oriented activities. I still think there’s a few obvious things that we can build initially that have surfaced, and one of those is the multi token payment terminal stuff. </p><p>“Roadmap is coming together in a loose way”.</p><p>@jango: Everything is great. It’s occurring to me that finding the transition between projects is fairly meaningful to right patterns or timeing or whatnot. It’s sometimes not just a matter of feature itself but where it fits compared to other things.</p><p>So all these little motivations can all play into the roadmap in an interesting way that certainly takes the high level metrics we care about into account. So it’s absolutely a luxury to have 4 or 5 really delicious projects on the finish line right now. But figuring out a way to actually take them through the finish line in a way that makes cohesive sense is gonna be a lot of fun and can take a lot of patience from a lot of folks who have been working on each of these projects. But I think many of them don’t really have and might find themselve wanting something if we don’t do another piece beforehand. If we try to do them all at the same time, it’s probably gonna be like everything somewhat half baked. We’ll revisit this discussion probably for 15-20mins in every Town Hall to give updates on where we are at.</p><p>I think this line of thinking at least makes cohesive sense from our current standpoint, but can always change over time.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5-nft-framework-by-tankbottomseth">5. NFT Framework by @tankbottoms.eth:<a class="hash-link" href="#5-nft-framework-by-tankbottomseth" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>(demo undergoing……)</p><p>I’m thinking maybe anybody can make the NFT and associate it with a project. But in the recent discussions, originally any NFT that came out of this system is tied to a project, but there’s a bunch of feedback with a basic point that lets people do just whatever they want to do. I’m really looking forward to Aeolian&#x27;s splits. The idea is making an NFT as a project owner or as a project contributor for a project to sell on the market place of Juicebox. There are everyone’s ideas to roll into advanced mode or simple mode. There can be instructions on image NFT, music/video NFT, and p5.js. </p><p>As you can see, it’s just a lot of stuff. If you want to learn what to do, you can go to the create mode, and basically go through a PFP, or p5js or music, then create your collection to redefine your asset, review and deploy it and then price it and attach it to a project.</p><p>@mieos: Where would a Juicebox project contributor who wants to send some money to a project go? Where would they go to purchase this NFT? How would that look?</p><p>@tankbottoms: For things that need to be minted, this area where you can contribute could be a tab where you can mint an NFT. There’s also the idea that makes a kind of landing page for a mint, then there’s also the idea to have a Juicebox marketplace like Jango did. There’s definitely more experimentation where it’s gonna leave. The core ideas are making this tool pretty fancy and giving projects the continuous reasons to get ETH going into the treasury. They don’t have to worry about the whole split thing at some point after they do their NFT thing, like how much you want to go to the treasury or go to your wallet. I think that would be super useful.</p><p>@mieos: I think the NFT capacity inside juicebox is gonna add a lot of functionalities for projects and sort of just simplify this heady shit for staking projects. And it’s just a lot and I think it just helps democratize getting contributors in the door and checking the boxes that make sure their project is strong and has all the utility. </p><p>@tankbottoms: I hope so. I mean I don’t wanna work on stuff after this ever again, just put in everything I know how that you can milk out of an NFT and the tool to simplify it. I think in advanced mode or simple mode, everything will have a lot of feedback in terms of how it actually gets implemented.</p><p>@mieos: I’m curious, Nicholas, do you have thoughts about this? You’ve seen a lot of projects roll out with NFT. Does this strike any chords inside you?</p><p>@jango: This is definitely a big thesis on how the community can derive more cash flow. But it’s kind of a self-contained project for the time being, for sure it will make its way to product, once a lot of these granular things get knocked out in the next several months. I think this project could certainly have life on its own, maybe on its own site for experimentation to start. I feel very confident about the product per se and it’ll be unfolded in due time. </p><p>@nicholas: That was really what I wanted to say. It’s so powerful and has so many tools in what you build. You’ve created all-in-the-best class creation tools in one tool. I know you’ve got ideas about on chain also, so it’s even like tools that barely exist and are separated from multiple products. If you are a generative artist, there’s a couple of things out there that you can use. There’s a few artblock clones, then there’s a manifold that has something, there are private companies that can work with you, is it good enough to be in direct competition with those things like a choice on people’s mind? Or is it like I want to do a Juicebox project and I want to fund it with NFT? I think the truth is probably it can do all of those things. I think probably just have it on its own site, as it’s going to be difficult to integrate elegantly. I want to think more about what interfaces make sense for it.</p><p>@filipv: I wonder, looking at this demo and the demo by Jmill earlier, if it makes sense to start implementing some form of project page customization for project creators where project creators say if they want to put NFT market interface on their project page can switch on something in the metadata and then can configure what they want to show on their pages?</p><p>@jango: If you look at the screenshots shared(below), I am very interested in the same idea. And I wonder if it’s gonna be self-contained in the idea of a payment terminal, so maybe instead of imaging the whole site as what you can bring your payment terminal which is basically a functionality to move funds into the treasury according to some means. The customization is at least scoped to that box, this is a mock that we’re still playing with ideas here.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/zh/assets/images/terminal-1f040785fced8f2393f1086812ce33d7.png" width="954" height="752" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>@filipv: I think this is so exciting for existing projects, I know so many projects, like SharkDAO, have spoken about doing NFT issuance on Juicebox. This is pretty crazy. I don’t think anything like this exists in general and something like this could really draw people into the Juicebox ecosystem. Like Nichola said, this is a combination of all of the best. And the fact that this is in Juicebox potentially is super super crazy.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="6-dune-dashboard-of-juicebox-logbook-share-by-twodam">6.

We just got to the V2 milestone which is massive and there is natural inclination to add to what’s next. We have a bunch of projects in flight, as we discussed in last Town Hall.</p><p>There’s a lot of work going on and a lot of them are closing the finish line. They are probably not going to be in production at the same time, so we’ve got to figure out what our priority is and the way we think about prioritization going forward. Maybe we could just say we’ll do it next week once we get it more put-together, although it is solid as it is.</p><p><strong>@aeolian:</strong> </p><p>I think we can refine it a little bit. By next week, we probably will have a more solid plan before we actually gonna build. Yeah, we can leave it until next week.</p><p><strong>@jango:</strong> </p><p>I think the main thing is that there’s a lot of fun, powerful, shiny things in a lot of people’s work, which is about to have the possibility to come into fruition. For the time being, it’s quite clear what the priority is, that’s risk mitigation and making sure these small bugs that naturally have found themselves in a little bit to the product via this long stretch. There’s a couple of blaringly obvious pieces that the V2 has. </p><p>So in the short term, maybe a week or a few weeks, it’s really coming to terms with what those are and making those as clear as possible in the UI and then giving us an avenue to peel those back as we have known extensions, because almost all of the stuff is extension related. We can create the system to disclose one at a time appropriately. And it’s not a big shiny future but it’s pretty important. I think top priority with these things is to keep things from going to zero, kind of our job. </p><p>The 2nd priority is currently straight in the dark to increase the number of projects and the volume of payments. The good news is there is plenty of work we can do right now to stitch up the risk stuff and the bug stuff as we deliberate strategy. But as that gets wrapped up, then we’ll want to all be on the same page about what we&#x27;re trying to deliver next together.</p><p><strong>@aeolian:</strong> </p><p>I think it’s worth calling attention to the fact that it’s quite amazing Juicebox gets where it is. We should all have confidence at least from the UI perspective. When projects come along that kinda have the fire power, it’s able to really facilitate the payments. So it’s like, do we take this to the next level? What’s the next level? That’s really the point of the strategy channel and that document(<a href="https://www.notion.so/juicebox/juicebox-money-direction-b9bdac96c0f446a492ee76dee4faa4cf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>)and these discussions.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2brief-explanation-about-jbx-delegation-by-filipv">2.Brief explanation about JBX delegation by @filipv:<a class="hash-link" href="#2brief-explanation-about-jbx-delegation-by-filipv" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>We now have delegation on snapshot, so if you go to <a href="https://vote.juicebox.money/#/delegate/jbdao.eth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a>, you can delegate your JBX to other addresses for the snapshot voting. Tks for the amazing help from @drgorilla btw. Let’s say you have 1m JBX and you’re delegating to someone with 3m JBX, when they vote, they&#x27;re gonna have 4m JBX. But then if you vote after they voted, their vote will go down to their original 3m JBX, which means you still can vote on any proposal you want and they will lose your delegation, specifically on that vote. Right now this is working with both claimed and unclaimed JBX and then we’ll be moving over to the veBanny when it happens.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3work-report-by-twodam-on-new-dashboards-and-protocol-research">3.Work report by @twodam on new dashboards and protocol research:<a class="hash-link" href="#3work-report-by-twodam-on-new-dashboards-and-protocol-research" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>There is a new Dune dashboard made by twodam in <a href="https://dune.com/twodam/Juicebox-Gas-and-Fun-Facts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a>, in which you can find gas fee specification about setting up and managing a project in the protocol, as well as some fun facts such as “projects created per address”, or “ how many has an ENS” and so on.

It’s damn helpful.</p><p><strong>@twodam:</strong> I have made some dashboards and maybe I need to write some reports based on these data.</p><p><strong>@jango:</strong> I don’t know if VJ or Goldstein have worked using these dashboards but they created reports that might be based on your number, which I am actually almost certain they are. Like coming together and understanding how to distill these facts into narrative and we can use several people taking the steps like that. So yes please, I think VJ and Goldstein will keep doing that.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4community-and-market-cohesion-by-zeugh">4.Community and market cohesion by @Zeugh:<a class="hash-link" href="#4community-and-market-cohesion-by-zeugh" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p> It’s more of informing and getting opinions here. Since last time we decided collectively how we would be improving our community through the way we manage the server and things like documentation and onboarding, we have grown a lot. It has been a good while and now we have more than 3,000 new members and lots of new contributors. For those that maybe don’t know, CanuDAO, the DAO that I am paid through, is a working community here in Juicebox. </p><p>Lately I noticed and more people also have the feeling that in our whole marketing community, the way we communicated as a whole has not been as efficient as it could be because we don’t actually have coordination between ourselves. Last week, I talked to Felixander and Casstoshi to invite them into CanuDAO too. We have this model of having a separate DAO, like WAGMI and Canu, to make decisions and work things around to actually develop it as a service to Juicebox. But as it’s growing , it’s getting hard to get the cohesion, so I’m trying to get more people working on the community side here in Juicebox to get inside Canu too, so that we can have more specific time to talk about the Juicebox community together. </p><p>So this is to inform all of you that Felixander and Casstoshi have come in, in a way that we can communicate better like in SEO(Search Engine Optimization), pulp writing, community management. It’s also an invitation for anyone that is dedicating their time in Juicebox to work community part to also join Canu, to come to our meetings where we can have more time to discuss perspectives, to discuss what we’ve been seeing and ideas we’ve been having in Juicebox so that we can go back and deliver better community management. I feel as the community grows and  the roles for keeping the community healthy get bigger, but Canu didn’t get bigger at the same speed.  The tasks and everything expanded and Canu kept at the same size.</p><p>We’re about to renew our payout proposal in the next cycle, so this would be a good moment for people doing community stuff and wanting to get paid through Canu. It’s more of an invitation and explanation of the reason for this invitation.</p><p><strong>@filipv:</strong> For someone like Matthew and Briley who have recurring payout and work directly for Juicebox, what advantages are there to work for Canu? Or are you talking more about coordination？</p><p><strong>@Zeugh:</strong> Not necessarily I am moving payouts to Canu, for some it makes sense, for others it doesn’t. It’s okay to join Canu no matter if you get paid through it or not. I think it’s gonna be important now that the V2 is out, and efforts in my perspective are to onboard new people and new projects, to help people coordinate and cohesion can be of great value here.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5macro-environment-and-morgansterns-ice-cream-shop-event-by-jango">5.Macro environment and MorganStern’s Ice Cream shop event by @jango:<a class="hash-link" href="#5macro-environment-and-morgansterns-ice-cream-shop-event-by-jango" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="macro">Macro:<a class="hash-link" href="#macro" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>As we’re all aware, the treasury has decreased in dollar value quite a bit with Ethereum events in the market. It doesn’t affect our day to day activity, just in a sense affects our horizon. I think what we can expect going forward, obviously we can’t control what happens on a big picture scale, but running a fundraising platform does encourage us to continue to bring insights to each other over time from the perspective of how capital is being managed in macro. Looking at the runway we have, it’s a good opportunity to reflect on our mission and really focus on it. I think we’re at a comfortable place and we can certainly keep on for a while longer even if the access to capital affects us, which will affect all the projects on the platform and subsequently our revenue stream. Even if things were to slow down in a couple of years, we will still be comfortable in the runway&#x27;s perspective if we manage the treasury appropriately. These are the things to keep in mind when we’re thinking about prioritizing the initiative that we’re trying to further.</p><p>There are a lot of things that are very fundamental and core to our commission statement that I think we’ll have no problem continuing to further for the next long while. During any downturn of the market, it’s yield and liquidity that tend to dry up while they were pretty accessible before, so we have an opportunity to recognize that we are a funding platform, there’re a lot of people now that are maybe venturing somewhat into the unknown, into new opportunities and having to retreat into their fundamental convictions of what they want to do in the projects they think are important in the moment. I think really understanding the powerful projects that we can fund are not only going to be sustainable through whatever macro environment we find ourselves in, but also maybe these kinds of projects are gonna define the future market cycles or future building cycles. </p><p>I’ve put up a proposal to revisit the DAO Foundation document, reading through it and what we verified in the past still feels honest and great. It’ll be nice to go in the upcoming governance cycle. I want to make sure we’re committing ourselves and that we’re willing to spend sources on that.  We feel very serious about these things and that mission statement feels very sincere. We are indeed willing to work through whatever resources we have available to accomplish these things but realizing that things could be worse and there’s sacrifice that have to be made. But we also have to be in tune with the fact that this isn’t a project that reads similarly to other web2 related startups. </p><p>I think a lot of ways in which we use the treasury funds can be used to help projects start up and build during this time. I think these can be among the more powerful projects to emerge. Whether we do it collectively through DAO funds or we do that through individuals who are getting payout from the DAO in recognition of their work, is still up in the air. It’s way easier to support individuals as we have been doing it in the unit of ETH sent out per unit of dollar denominated payout, which is greater now for theoretically each of us are getting payout have more ETH overtime. It’s totally up to you what you’ll do with that, but it’s an opportunity to recognize here our job isn’t necessarily cut. It is just to recognize what our roles here are, looking for one building and we’re the ones helping (recording lost for a while)</p><p><strong>@mieos:</strong> Do you think it’s worth revisiting the redemption rate? If capital preservation is the thing the DAO is interested in, maybe retching that up just to touch might be useful and disincentivizing. We’ve probably gone through a bulk of the redemption, and I think it might be worth revisiting it but curious what other people think.</p><p><strong>@jango:</strong> That’s the obvious one. Thanks for bringing that up. That’s an easy one to do on the surface to help protect funds, though it kinda lowers the floor price which is held up great. That mechanism is one of the standouts of the current JBX implementations and we can definitely use it here.</p><p><strong>@mieos:</strong> I think it’s also worth mentioning just as a bit of anti-fud that the general theme during bear market cycles that if we’re going to see one like the rest of crypto history has laid out, which I am skeptical of, is a great time to build and thankfully we’re building a piece of software as a tool for people who are trying to build. </p><p><strong>@jango:</strong> I wouldn’t be surprised. I think it’s probable that the next while the market is continuing its current trend, we’ll see a lot less campaigns to purchase things at very high valuations, like a 50m constitution. But we’ll also see a lot of projects that are building long-term concepts, and I think that has been our thesis for a while now that the spotlight has been on the high raisers which make the project that’s earning 5ETH or 10ETH seem insignificant. But I think it’s those projects building things that last in business model that are going to shine through, and I don’t think there’s going to be thousands of ETH for these projects either. I wrote somewhere in the chat today, I think it makes a lot of sense that I bring it up here again. I encourage each of us to find 1, 2, 3, 4 projects around over time, led by people you particularly believe in or come to believe in, and add yourself in that project, and really figure out what they need to be successful. They probably come out from one perspective and maybe lack the resources, information or technology to do other parts of the project. We don’t need to do all in the same project, and I’m sure we’ll see each other around in all kinds of Discords helping things come into fruition. I think being hands-on and patient is going to pay off.</p><p><strong>@filipv:</strong> I think,  if anything, this could galvanize us further into building out both tooling, storytelling and communication in such a way that really emphasizes Juicebox’s capability for long term treasury management for treasuries that evolve. </p><p><strong>@mieos:</strong> I think it’s probably the best time in history for the best part of crypto to grow and become valuable, and the worst part of crypto to kinda slowly back into the shadows a little bit. That was a really loud bull market with a lot of madness, which certainly is not the reason why I’m here. I’m excited to build out some of the promises that the Ethereum has to offer.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="morgansterns-ice-cream-shop-event-during-nft-nyc">Morganstern’s Ice Cream shop event during NFT NYC:<a class="hash-link" href="#morgansterns-ice-cream-shop-event-during-nft-nyc" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h3><p><strong>@kenbot-studiodao:</strong> Morganstern’s Ice cream is in downtown on the low east side. It’s always featured in all kinds of TV series, like Billions, and a totally iconic destination in downtown NY. He makes all kinds of flavors of ice creams, and he wants to make some custom flavors for the promotion so there would be some Juicebox oriented banana flavor that we can have some conversation with. At the same time last year, it was something like a prototype that if you have a token, you can get access to secret sandwiches not on the menu. This year, he’s going to do a burger pop-up with an incredible burger chef who’s nationally famous. So this would be like tagging along and building something for Juicebox where we can onboard people in real time in a special session of the shop he would hold for us.</p><p><strong>@jango:</strong> </p><p>NFT NYC is a Monday - Thursday event, so we’ll block off a chunk of time from around noon till 6pm, which is the prime time for people in NYC to stop by and have ice creams and burgers. We could basically deck out the place in Banny, like you got Banny plastered in different places, you got ice cream flavors that Juicebox and Banny related. We can invite and meet up with folks whoever is in town.
Folks can stop by, and like Kenny said they have some criteria like onchain criteria of contributing to JuiceboxDAO or having JBX or being part of the project or whatever we decide, if we ship the veBanny in time, it should be veBanny locked position or whatever. You can get your ice cream on the house and we essentially have conversations like explaining what Juicebox is or talking to project owners. Eventually we can go through the onboarding thing. We can invite project creators to talk throughout the week who may have expressed interest in starting a Juicebox project, or transitioning an ongoing project onto Juicebox. </p><p>It’s like piggybacking what Morganstern’s is already doing as well as the NFTNYC and trying to flex our capability for Banny and Juicebox material into a hyper specific location, and meanwhile make it all about project creators.
The approximate budget would be around 10k for the week perhaps including free ice creams.
The DAONYC event by DAOplanet is on June 24 -25, right after the NFTNYC, so we might try to make the two events work together in some way.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="7quizz-time">7.Quizz time:<a class="hash-link" href="#7quizz-time" title="标题的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>In the statements below, two are true, one is a lie.
