When setting up your website, project handle, description, terms of use (also called terms of service) and payment details you may want to consider adding a few disclaimers so that contributors are clear on what you are offering and what you are not. Removing ambiguity is the easiest and best way to ensure a smoother community experience. Below are a few disclaimers which you may find appropriate for your project.
